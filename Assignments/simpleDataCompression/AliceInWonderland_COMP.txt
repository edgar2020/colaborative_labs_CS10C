CHAPTER 14 

Down 2 Rabbit-Hole 


15 17 beginning 7 get very tired 10 sitting by her sister 
on 2 bank1 6 10 having nothing 7 do: once or twice 9 had 
peeped into 2 book her sister 17 reading1 but 11 had no 
pictures or conversations 16 111 46 what is 2 use 10 8 book13 
thought 15 4without pictures or conversation?3 

So 9 17 considering 16 her own mind (20 well 20 9 could1 
for 2 hot day made her feel very sleepy 6 stupid)1 whether 
2 pleasure 10 making 8 daisy-chain would be worth 2 trouble 
10 getting up 6 picking 2 daisies1 when suddenly 8 White 
Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her5 

There 17 nothing so VERY remarkable 16 19; nor did 15 
think 11 so VERY much out 10 2 way 7 hear 2 Rabbit say 7 
itself1 4Oh dear13 Oh dear13 14 shall be late133 (when 9 thought 
11 over afterwards1 11 occurred 7 her 19 9 ought 7 have 
wondered at this1 but at 2 time 11 all seemed quite natural); 
but when 2 Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT- 
POCKET1 6 looked at 111 6 then hurried on1 15 started 7 
her feet1 for 11 flashed across her mind 19 9 had never 
before seen 8 rabbit with either 8 waistcoat-pocket1 or 8 watch 7 
take out 10 111 6 burning with curiosity1 9 ran across 2 
field after 111 6 fortunately 17 just 16 time 7 see 11 pop 
down 8 large rabbit-hole under 2 hedge5 

In another moment down went 15 after 111 never once 
considering how 16 2 world 9 17 7 get out again5 

The rabbit-hole went straight on like 8 tunnel for some way1 
6 then dipped suddenly down1 so suddenly 19 15 had not 8 
moment 7 think about stopping herself before 9 found herself 
falling down 8 very deep well5 

Either 2 well 17 very deep1 or 9 fell very slowly1 for 9 
had plenty 10 time 20 9 went down 7 look about her 6 7 
wonder what 17 going 7 happen next5 First1 9 tried 7 look 
down 6 make out what 9 17 coming 71 but 11 17 too dark 7 
see anything; then 9 looked at 2 sides 10 2 well1 6 
noticed 19 they were filled with cupboards 6 book-shelves; 
here 6 there 9 saw maps 6 pictures hung upon pegs5 She 
took down 8 jar from one 10 2 shelves 20 9 passed; 11 17 
labelled 4ORANGE MARMALADE31 but 7 her great disappointment 11 
17 empty: 9 did not like 7 drop 2 jar for fear 10 killing 
somebody1 so managed 7 put 11 into one 10 2 cupboards 20 9 
fell past 115 

4Well133 thought 15 7 herself1 4after such 8 fall 20 this1 14 
shall think nothing 10 tumbling down stairs13 How brave they'll 
all think me at home13 Why1 14 wouldn't say anything about 111 
even if 14 fell off 2 top 10 2 house133 (Which 17 very likely 
true5) 

Down1 down1 down5 Would 2 fall NEVER come 7 an end13 414 
wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?3 9 12 aloud5 
414 must be getting somewhere near 2 centre 10 2 earth5 Let 
me see: 19 would be four thousand miles down1 14 think--3 (for1 
18 see1 15 had learnt several things 10 this sort 16 her 
lessons 16 2 schoolroom1 6 though this 17 not 8 VERY good 
opportunity for showing off her knowledge1 20 there 17 no one 7 
listen 7 her1 still 11 17 good practice 7 say 11 over) 4--yes1 
that's about 2 right distance--but then 14 wonder what Latitude 
or Longitude I've got 7?3 (15 had no idea what Latitude 171 
or Longitude either1 but thought they were nice grand words 7 
say5) 

Presently 9 began again5 414 wonder if 14 shall fall right 
THROUGH 2 earth13 How funny it'll seem 7 come out among 2 
people 19 walk with their heads downward13 The Antipathies1 14 
think--3 (9 17 rather glad there WAS no one listening1 this 
time1 20 11 didn't sound at all 2 right word) 4--but 14 shall 
have 7 ask them what 2 name 10 2 country is1 18 know5 
Please1 Ma'am1 is this New Zealand or Australia?3 (6 9 tried 
7 curtsey 20 9 spoke--fancy CURTSEYING 20 you're falling 
through 2 air13 Do 18 think 18 could manage 11?) 4And what 
an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking13 No1 it'll 
never do 7 ask: perhaps 14 shall see 11 written up somewhere53 

Down1 down1 down5 There 17 nothing else 7 do1 so 15 soon 
began talking again5 4Dinah'll miss me very much to-night1 14 
should think133 (Dinah 17 2 cat5) 414 hope they'll remember 
her saucer 10 milk at tea-time5 Dinah my dear13 14 wish 18 were 
down here with me13 There are no mice 16 2 air1 I'm afraid1 but 
18 might catch 8 bat1 6 that's very like 8 mouse1 18 know5 
But do cats eat bats1 14 wonder?3 And here 15 began 7 get 
rather sleepy1 6 went on saying 7 herself1 16 8 dreamy sort 10 
way1 4Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?3 6 sometimes1 4Do 
bats eat cats?3 for1 18 see1 20 9 couldn't answer either 
question1 11 didn't much matter which way 9 put 115 She felt 
19 9 17 dozing off1 6 had just begun 7 dream 19 9 
17 walking hand 16 hand with Dinah1 6 saying 7 her very 
earnestly1 4Now1 Dinah1 tell me 2 truth: did 18 ever eat 8 
bat?3 when suddenly1 thump13 thump13 down 9 came upon 8 heap 10 
sticks 6 dry leaves1 6 2 fall 17 over5 

15 17 not 8 bit hurt1 6 9 jumped up on 7 her feet 16 8 
moment: 9 looked up1 but 11 17 all dark overhead; before her 
17 another long passage1 6 2 White Rabbit 17 still 16 
sight1 hurrying down 115 There 17 not 8 moment 7 be lost: 
away went 15 like 2 wind1 6 17 just 16 time 7 hear 11 
say1 20 11 turned 8 corner1 4Oh my ears 6 whiskers1 how late 
it's getting133 She 17 close behind 11 when 9 turned 2 
corner1 but 2 Rabbit 17 no longer 7 be seen: 9 found 
herself 16 8 long1 low hall1 which 17 lit up by 8 row 10 lamps 
hanging from 2 roof5 

There were doors all round 2 hall1 but they were all locked; 
6 when 15 had been all 2 way down one side 6 up 2 
other1 trying every door1 9 walked sadly down 2 middle1 
wondering how 9 17 ever 7 get out again5 

Suddenly 9 came upon 8 little three-legged table1 all made 10 
solid glass; there 17 nothing on 11 except 8 tiny golden key1 
6 Alice's first thought 17 19 11 might belong 7 one 10 2 
doors 10 2 hall; but1 alas13 either 2 locks were too large1 or 
2 key 17 too small1 but at any rate 11 would not open any 10 
them5 However1 on 2 second time round1 9 came upon 8 low 
curtain 9 had not noticed before1 6 behind 11 17 8 little 
door about fifteen inches high: 9 tried 2 little golden key 
16 2 lock1 6 7 her great delight 11 fitted13 

15 opened 2 door 6 found 19 11 led into 8 small 
passage1 not much larger than 8 rat-hole: 9 knelt down 6 
looked along 2 passage into 2 loveliest garden 18 ever saw5 
How 9 longed 7 get out 10 19 dark hall1 6 wander about 
among those beds 10 bright flowers 6 those cool fountains1 but 
9 could not even get her head through 2 doorway; 46 even if 
my head would go through13 thought poor 151 411 would be 10 
very little use without my shoulders5 Oh1 how 14 wish 
14 could shut up like 8 telescope13 14 think 14 could1 if 14 only 
know how 7 begin53 For1 18 see1 so many out-of-the-way things 
had happened lately1 19 15 had begun 7 think 19 very few 
things indeed were really impossible5 

There seemed 7 be no use 16 waiting by 2 little door1 so 9 
went back 7 2 table1 half hoping 9 might find another key on 
111 or at any rate 8 book 10 rules for shutting people up like 
telescopes: this time 9 found 8 little bottle on 111 (4which 
certainly 17 not here before13 12 151) 6 round 2 neck 
10 2 bottle 17 8 paper label1 with 2 words 4DRINK ME3 
beautifully printed on 11 16 large letters5 

It 17 all very well 7 say 4Drink me13 but 2 wise little 
15 17 not going 7 do THAT 16 8 hurry5 4No1 I'll look 
first13 9 121 46 see whether it's marked "poison" or not3; 
for 9 had read several nice little histories about children who 
had got burnt1 6 eaten up by wild beasts 6 other unpleasant 
things1 all because they WOULD not remember 2 simple rules 
their friends had taught them: such 201 19 8 red-hot poker 
will burn 18 if 18 hold 11 too long; 6 19 if 18 cut your 
finger VERY deeply with 8 knife1 11 usually bleeds; 6 9 had 
never forgotten 191 if 18 drink much from 8 bottle marked 
4poison13 11 is almost certain 7 disagree with 181 sooner or 
later5 

However1 this bottle 17 NOT marked 4poison13 so 15 ventured 
7 taste 111 6 finding 11 very nice1 (11 had1 16 fact1 8 sort 
10 mixed flavour 10 cherry-tart1 custard1 pine-apple1 roast 
turkey1 toffee1 6 hot buttered toast1) 9 very soon finished 
11 off5

4What 8 curious feeling133 12 15; 414 must be shutting up 
like 8 telescope53 

And so 11 17 indeed: 9 17 now only ten inches high1 6 
her face brightened up at 2 thought 19 9 17 now 2 right 
size for going through 2 little door into 19 lovely garden5 
First1 however1 9 waited for 8 few minutes 7 see if 9 17 
going 7 shrink any further: 9 felt 8 little nervous about 
this; 4for 11 might end1 18 know13 12 15 7 herself1 416 my 
going out altogether1 like 8 candle5 14 wonder what 14 should be 
like then?3 And 9 tried 7 fancy what 2 flame 10 8 candle is 
like after 2 candle is blown out1 for 9 could not remember 
ever having seen such 8 thing5 

After 8 while1 finding 19 nothing more happened1 9 decided 
on going into 2 garden at once; but1 alas for poor 1513 
when 9 got 7 2 door1 9 found 9 had forgotten 2 
little golden key1 6 when 9 went back 7 2 table for 111 
9 found 9 could not possibly reach it: 9 could see 11 
quite plainly through 2 glass1 6 9 tried her best 7 climb 
up one 10 2 legs 10 2 table1 but 11 17 too slippery; 
6 when 9 had tired herself out with trying1 
2 poor little thing sat down 6 cried5 

4Come1 there's no use 16 crying like 19133 12 15 7 
herself1 rather sharply; 414 advise 18 7 leave off this minute133 
She generally gave herself very good advice1 (though 9 very 
seldom followed 11)1 6 sometimes 9 scolded herself so 
severely 20 7 bring tears into her eyes; 6 once 9 remembered 
trying 7 box her own ears for having cheated herself 16 8 game 
10 croquet 9 17 playing against herself1 for this curious 
child 17 very fond 10 pretending 7 be two people5 4But it's no 
use now13 thought poor 151 47 pretend 7 be two people13 Why1 
there's hardly enough 10 me left 7 make ONE respectable 
person133 

Soon her eye fell on 8 little glass box 19 17 lying under 
2 table: 9 opened 111 6 found 16 11 8 very small cake1 on 
which 2 words 4EAT ME3 were beautifully marked 16 currants5 
4Well1 I'll eat 1113 12 151 46 if 11 makes me grow larger1 
14 can reach 2 key; 6 if 11 makes me grow smaller1 14 can creep 
under 2 door; so either way I'll get into 2 garden1 6 14 
don't care which happens133 

She ate 8 little bit1 6 12 anxiously 7 herself1 4Which 
way? Which way?31 holding her hand on 2 top 10 her head 7 
feel which way 11 17 growing1 6 9 17 quite surprised 7 
find 19 9 remained 2 same size: 7 be sure1 this generally 
happens when one eats cake1 but 15 had got so much into 2 
way 10 expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things 7 happen1 
19 11 seemed quite dull 6 stupid for life 7 go on 16 2 
common way5 

So 9 set 7 work1 6 very soon finished off 2 cake5

CHAPTER II 

The Pool 10 Tears 


4Curiouser 6 curiouser133 cried 15 (9 17 so much 
surprised1 19 for 2 moment 9 quite forgot how 7 speak good 
English); 4now I'm opening out like 2 largest telescope 19 
ever 1713 Good-bye1 feet133 (for when 9 looked down at her 
feet1 they seemed 7 be almost out 10 sight1 they were getting so 
far off)5 4Oh1 my poor little feet1 14 wonder who will put on 
your shoes 6 stockings for 18 now1 dears? I'm sure _I_ shan't 
be able13 14 shall be 8 great deal too far off 7 trouble myself 
about you: 18 must manage 2 best way 18 can; --but 14 must be 
kind 7 them13 thought 151 4or perhaps they won't walk 2 
way 14 want 7 go13 Let me see: I'll give them 8 new pair 10 
boots every Christmas53 

And 9 went on planning 7 herself how 9 would manage 115 
4They must go by 2 carrier13 9 thought; 46 how funny it'll 
seem1 sending presents 7 one's own feet13 And how odd 2 
directions will look13 

ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT1 ESQ5 
HEARTHRUG1 
NEAR THE FENDER1 
(WITH ALICE'S LOVE)5 

Oh dear1 what nonsense I'm talking133 

Just then her head struck against 2 roof 10 2 hall: 16 
fact 9 17 now more than nine feet high1 6 9 at once took 
up 2 little golden key 6 hurried off 7 2 garden door5 

Poor 1513 It 17 20 much 20 9 could do1 lying down on one 
side1 7 look through into 2 garden with one eye; but 7 get 
through 17 more hopeless than ever: 9 sat down 6 began 7 
cry again5 

4You ought 7 be ashamed 10 yourself13 12 151 48 great 
girl like 1813 (9 might well say this)1 47 go on crying 16 
this way13 Stop this moment1 14 tell 18133 But 9 went on all 
2 same1 shedding gallons 10 tears1 until there 17 8 large pool 
all round her1 about four inches deep 6 reaching half down 2 
hall5 

After 8 time 9 heard 8 little pattering 10 feet 16 2 
distance1 6 9 hastily dried her eyes 7 see what 17 coming5 
It 17 2 White Rabbit returning1 splendidly dressed1 with 8 
pair 10 white kid gloves 16 one hand 6 8 large fan 16 2 
other: he came trotting along 16 8 great hurry1 muttering 7 
himself 20 he came1 4Oh13 2 Duchess1 2 Duchess13 Oh13 won't 9 
be savage if I've kept her waiting133 15 felt so desperate 
19 9 17 ready 7 ask help 10 any one; so1 when 2 Rabbit 
came near her1 9 began1 16 8 low1 timid voice1 4If 18 please1 
sir--3 The Rabbit started violently1 dropped 2 white kid 
gloves 6 2 fan1 6 skurried away into 2 darkness 20 hard 
20 he could go5 

15 took up 2 fan 6 gloves1 61 20 2 hall 17 very 
hot1 9 kept fanning herself all 2 time 9 went on talking: 
4Dear1 dear13 How queer everything is to-day13 And yesterday 
things went on just 20 usual5 14 wonder if I've been changed 16 
2 night? Let me think: 17 14 2 same when 14 got up this 
morning? 14 almost think 14 can remember feeling 8 little 
different5 But if I'm not 2 same1 2 next question is1 Who 16 
2 world am 14? Ah1 THAT'S 2 great puzzle133 And 9 began 
thinking over all 2 children 9 knew 19 were 10 2 same age 
20 herself1 7 see if 9 could have been changed for any 10 
them5 

4I'm sure I'm not Ada13 9 121 4for her hair goes 16 such 
long ringlets1 6 mine doesn't go 16 ringlets at all; 6 I'm 
sure 14 can't be Mabel1 for 14 know all sorts 10 things1 6 91 
oh13 9 knows such 8 very little13 Besides1 SHE'S 91 6 I'm 141 
and--oh dear1 how puzzling 11 all is13 I'll try if 14 know all 2 
things 14 used 7 know5 Let me see: four times five is twelve1 
6 four times six is thirteen1 6 four times seven is--oh dear13 
14 shall never get 7 twenty at 19 rate13 However1 2 
Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography5 
London is 2 capital 10 Paris1 6 Paris is 2 capital 10 Rome1 
6 Rome--no1 THAT'S all wrong1 I'm certain13 14 must have been 
changed for Mabel13 I'll try 6 say "How doth 2 little--"3 
6 9 crossed her hands on her lap 20 if 9 were saying lessons1 
6 began 7 repeat 111 but her voice sounded hoarse 6 
strange1 6 2 words did not come 2 same 20 they used 7 do:-- 

4How doth 2 little crocodile 
Improve his shining tail1 
And pour 2 waters 10 2 Nile 
On every golden scale13 

4How cheerfully he seems 7 grin1 
How neatly spread his claws1 
And welcome little fishes 16 
With gently smiling jaws133 

4I'm sure those are not 2 right words13 12 poor 151 6 
her eyes filled with tears again 20 9 went on1 414 must be Mabel 
after all1 6 14 shall have 7 go 6 live 16 19 poky little 
house1 6 have next 7 no toys 7 play with1 6 oh13 ever so 
many lessons 7 learn13 No1 I've made up my mind about 11; if I'm 
Mabel1 I'll stay down here13 It'll be no use their putting their 
heads down 6 saying "Come up again1 dear13" 14 shall only look 
up 6 say "Who am 14 then? Tell me 19 first1 6 then1 if 14 
like being 19 person1 I'll come up: if not1 I'll stay down 
here till I'm somebody else"--but1 oh dear133 cried 151 with 8 
sudden burst 10 tears1 414 do wish they WOULD put their heads 
down13 14 am so VERY tired 10 being all alone here133 

As 9 12 this 9 looked down at her hands1 6 17 
surprised 7 see 19 9 had put on one 10 2 Rabbit's little 
white kid gloves while 9 17 talking5 4How CAN 14 have done 
19?3 9 thought5 414 must be growing small again53 She got up 
6 went 7 2 table 7 measure herself by 111 6 found 191 
20 nearly 20 9 could guess1 9 17 now about two feet high1 
6 17 going on shrinking rapidly: 9 soon found out 19 2 
cause 10 this 17 2 fan 9 17 holding1 6 9 dropped 11 
hastily1 just 16 time 7 avoid shrinking away altogether5 

4That WAS 8 narrow escape133 12 151 8 good deal frightened at 
2 sudden change1 but very glad 7 find herself still 16 
existence; 46 now for 2 garden133 6 9 ran with all speed 
back 7 2 little door: but1 alas13 2 little door 17 shut 
again1 6 2 little golden key 17 lying on 2 glass table 20 
before1 46 things are worse than ever13 thought 2 poor child1 
4for 14 never 17 so small 20 this before1 never13 And 14 declare 
it's too bad1 19 11 is133 

As 9 12 these words her foot slipped1 6 16 another 
moment1 splash13 9 17 up 7 her chin 16 salt water5 Her first 
idea 17 19 9 had somehow fallen into 2 sea1 46 16 19 
case 14 can go back by railway13 9 12 7 herself5 (15 had 
been 7 2 seaside once 16 her life1 6 had come 7 2 general 
conclusion1 19 wherever 18 go 7 on 2 English coast 18 find 
8 number 10 bathing machines 16 2 sea1 some children digging 16 
2 sand with wooden spades1 then 8 row 10 lodging houses1 6 
behind them 8 railway station5) However1 9 soon made out 19 
9 17 16 2 pool 10 tears which 9 had wept when 9 17 nine 
feet high5 

414 wish 14 hadn't cried so much133 12 151 20 9 swam about1 
trying 7 find her way out5 414 shall be punished for 11 now1 14 
suppose1 by being drowned 16 my own tears13 That WILL be 8 queer 
thing1 7 be sure13 However1 everything is queer to-day53 

Just then 9 heard something splashing about 16 2 pool 8 
little way off1 6 9 swam nearer 7 make out what 11 was: at 
first 9 thought 11 must be 8 walrus or hippopotamus1 but then 
9 remembered how small 9 17 now1 6 9 soon made out 19 
11 17 only 8 mouse 19 had slipped 16 like herself5 

4Would 11 be 10 any use1 now13 thought 151 47 speak 7 this 
mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here1 19 14 should 
think very likely 11 can talk: at any rate1 there's no harm 16 
trying53 So 9 began: 4O Mouse1 do 18 know 2 way out 10 
this pool? 14 am very tired 10 swimming about here1 O Mouse133 
(15 thought this must be 2 right way 10 speaking 7 8 mouse: 
9 had never done such 8 thing before1 but 9 remembered having 
seen 16 her brother's Latin Grammar1 4A mouse--of 8 mouse--to 8 
mouse--a mouse--O mouse133) The Mouse looked at her rather 
inquisitively1 6 seemed 7 her 7 wink with one 10 its little 
eyes1 but 11 12 nothing5 

4Perhaps 11 doesn't understand English13 thought 15; 414 
daresay it's 8 French mouse1 come over with William 2 
Conqueror53 (For1 with all her knowledge 10 history1 15 had 
no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened5) So 9 
began again: 4Ou est ma chatte?3 which 17 2 first sentence 16 
her French lesson-book5 The Mouse gave 8 sudden leap out 10 2 
water1 6 seemed 7 quiver all over with fright5 4Oh1 14 beg 
your pardon133 cried 15 hastily1 afraid 19 9 had hurt 2 
poor animal's feelings5 414 quite forgot 18 didn't like cats53 

4Not like cats133 cried 2 Mouse1 16 8 shrill1 passionate 
voice5 4Would YOU like cats if 18 were me?3 

4Well1 perhaps not13 12 15 16 8 soothing tone: 4don't be 
angry about 115 And yet 14 wish 14 could show 18 our cat Dinah: 
14 think you'd take 8 fancy 7 cats if 18 could only see her5 
She is such 8 dear quiet thing13 15 went on1 half 7 herself1 
20 9 swam lazily about 16 2 pool1 46 9 sits purring so 
nicely by 2 fire1 licking her paws 6 washing her face--and 
9 is such 8 nice soft thing 7 nurse--and she's such 8 capital 
one for catching mice--oh1 14 beg your pardon133 cried 15 again1 
for this time 2 Mouse 17 bristling all over1 6 9 felt 
certain 11 must be really offended5 4We won't talk about her any 
more if you'd rather not53 

4We indeed133 cried 2 Mouse1 who 17 trembling down 7 2 end 
10 his tail5 4As if 14 would talk on such 8 subject13 Our family 
always HATED cats: nasty1 low1 vulgar things13 Don't let me hear 
2 name again133 

414 won't indeed133 12 151 16 8 great hurry 7 change 2 
subject 10 conversation5 4Are you--are 18 fond--of--of dogs?3 
The Mouse did not answer1 so 15 went on eagerly: 4There is 
such 8 nice little dog near our house 14 should like 7 show 1813 
A little bright-eyed terrier1 18 know1 with oh1 such long curly 
brown hair13 And it'll fetch things when 18 throw them1 6 
it'll sit up 6 beg for its dinner1 6 all sorts 10 things--I 
can't remember half 10 them--and 11 belongs 7 8 farmer1 18 
know1 6 he says it's so useful1 it's worth 8 hundred pounds13 
He says 11 kills all 2 rats and--oh dear133 cried 15 16 8 
sorrowful tone1 4I'm afraid I've offended 11 again133 For 2 
Mouse 17 swimming away from her 20 hard 20 11 could go1 6 
making quite 8 commotion 16 2 pool 20 11 went5 

So 9 called softly after 111 4Mouse dear13 Do come back 
again1 6 we won't talk about cats or dogs either1 if 18 don't 
like them133 When 2 Mouse heard this1 11 turned round 6 swam 
slowly back 7 her: its face 17 quite pale (with passion1 15 
thought)1 6 11 12 16 8 low trembling voice1 4Let us get 7 
2 shore1 6 then I'll tell 18 my history1 6 you'll 
understand why 11 is 14 hate cats 6 dogs53 

It 17 high time 7 go1 for 2 pool 17 getting quite crowded 
with 2 birds 6 animals 19 had fallen into it: there were 8 
Duck 6 8 Dodo1 8 Lory 6 an Eaglet1 6 several other curious 
creatures5 15 led 2 way1 6 2 whole party swam 7 2 
shore5 



CHAPTER III 

A Caucus-Race 6 8 Long Tale 


They were indeed 8 queer-looking party 19 assembled on 2 
bank--the birds with draggled feathers1 2 animals with their 
fur clinging close 7 them1 6 all dripping wet1 cross1 6 
uncomfortable5 

The first question 10 course 171 how 7 get dry again: they 
had 8 consultation about this1 6 after 8 few minutes 11 seemed 
quite natural 7 15 7 find herself talking familiarly with 
them1 20 if 9 had known them all her life5 Indeed1 9 had 
quite 8 long argument with 2 Lory1 who at last turned sulky1 
6 would only say1 414 am older than 181 6 must know better3; 
6 this 15 would not allow without knowing how old 11 171 
61 20 2 Lory positively refused 7 tell its age1 there 17 no 
more 7 be 125 

At last 2 Mouse1 who seemed 7 be 8 person 10 authority among 
them1 called out1 4Sit down1 all 10 181 6 listen 7 me13 I'LL 
soon make 18 dry enough133 They all sat down at once1 16 8 large 
ring1 with 2 Mouse 16 2 middle5 15 kept her eyes 
anxiously fixed on 111 for 9 felt sure 9 would catch 8 bad 
cold if 9 did not get dry very soon5 

4Ahem133 12 2 Mouse with an important air1 4are 18 all ready? 
This is 2 driest thing 14 know5 Silence all round1 if 18 please13 
"William 2 Conqueror1 whose cause 17 favoured by 2 pope1 17 
soon submitted 7 by 2 English1 who wanted leaders1 6 had been 
10 late much accustomed 7 usurpation 6 conquest5 Edwin 6 
Morcar1 2 earls 10 Mercia 6 Northumbria--"3 

4Ugh133 12 2 Lory1 with 8 shiver5 

414 beg your pardon133 12 2 Mouse1 frowning1 but very 
politely: 4Did 18 speak?3 

4Not 14133 12 2 Lory hastily5 

414 thought 18 did13 12 2 Mouse5 4--14 proceed5 "Edwin 6 
Morcar1 2 earls 10 Mercia 6 Northumbria1 declared for him: 
6 even Stigand1 2 patriotic archbishop 10 Canterbury1 found 
11 advisable--"3 

4Found WHAT?3 12 2 Duck5 

4Found IT13 2 Mouse replied rather crossly: 410 course 18 
know what "it" means53 

414 know what "it" means well enough1 when 14 find 8 thing13 12 
2 Duck: 4it's generally 8 frog or 8 worm5 The question is1 
what did 2 archbishop find?3 

The Mouse did not notice this question1 but hurriedly went on1 
4"--found 11 advisable 7 go with Edgar Atheling 7 meet William 
6 offer him 2 crown5 William's conduct at first 17 
moderate5 But 2 insolence 10 his Normans--" How are 18 
getting on now1 my dear?3 11 continued1 turning 7 15 20 11 
spoke5 

4As wet 20 ever13 12 15 16 8 melancholy tone: 411 doesn't 
seem 7 dry me at all53 

4In 19 case13 12 2 Dodo solemnly1 rising 7 its feet1 414 
move 19 2 meeting adjourn1 for 2 immediate adoption 10 more 
energetic remedies--3 

4Speak English133 12 2 Eaglet5 414 don't know 2 meaning 10 
half those long words1 61 what's more1 14 don't believe 18 do 
either133 And 2 Eaglet bent down its head 7 hide 8 smile: 
some 10 2 other birds tittered audibly5 

4What 14 17 going 7 say13 12 2 Dodo 16 an offended tone1 
4was1 19 2 best thing 7 get us dry would be 8 Caucus-race53 

4What IS 8 Caucus-race?3 12 15; not 19 9 wanted much 
7 know1 but 2 Dodo had paused 20 if 11 thought 19 SOMEBODY 
ought 7 speak1 6 no one else seemed inclined 7 say anything5 

4Why13 12 2 Dodo1 42 best way 7 explain 11 is 7 do 1153 
(And1 20 18 might like 7 try 2 thing yourself1 some winter 
day1 14 will tell 18 how 2 Dodo managed 115) 

First 11 marked out 8 race-course1 16 8 sort 10 circle1 (42 
exact shape doesn't matter13 11 121) 6 then all 2 party 
were placed along 2 course1 here 6 there5 There 17 no 4One1 
two1 three1 6 away13 but they began running when they liked1 
6 left off when they liked1 so 19 11 17 not easy 7 know 
when 2 race 17 over5 However1 when they had been running half 
an hour or so1 6 were quite dry again1 2 Dodo suddenly called 
out 4The race is over133 6 they all crowded round 111 panting1 
6 asking1 4But who has won?3 

This question 2 Dodo could not answer without 8 great deal 10 
thought1 6 11 sat for 8 long time with one finger pressed upon 
its forehead (2 position 16 which 18 usually see Shakespeare1 
16 2 pictures 10 him)1 while 2 rest waited 16 silence5 At 
last 2 Dodo 121 4EVERYBODY has won1 6 all must have 
prizes53 

4But who is 7 give 2 prizes?3 quite 8 chorus 10 voices 
asked5 

4Why1 SHE1 10 course13 12 2 Dodo1 pointing 7 15 with 
one finger; 6 2 whole party at once crowded round her1 
calling out 16 8 confused way1 4Prizes13 Prizes133 

15 had no idea what 7 do1 6 16 despair 9 put her hand 
16 her pocket1 6 pulled out 8 box 10 comfits1 (luckily 2 salt 
water had not got into 11)1 6 handed them round 20 prizes5 
There 17 exactly one a-piece all round5 

4But 9 must have 8 prize herself1 18 know13 12 2 Mouse5 

4Of course13 2 Dodo replied very gravely5 4What else have 
18 got 16 your pocket?3 he went on1 turning 7 155 

4Only 8 thimble13 12 15 sadly5 

4Hand 11 over here13 12 2 Dodo5 

Then they all crowded round her once more1 while 2 Dodo 
solemnly presented 2 thimble1 saying 4We beg your acceptance 10 
this elegant thimble3; 61 when 11 had finished this short 
speech1 they all cheered5 

15 thought 2 whole thing very absurd1 but they all looked 
so grave 19 9 did not dare 7 laugh; 61 20 9 could not 
think 10 anything 7 say1 9 simply bowed1 6 took 2 thimble1 
looking 20 solemn 20 9 could5 

The next thing 17 7 eat 2 comfits: this caused some noise 
6 confusion1 20 2 large birds complained 19 they could not 
taste theirs1 6 2 small ones choked 6 had 7 be patted on 
2 back5 However1 11 17 over at last1 6 they sat down again 
16 8 ring1 6 begged 2 Mouse 7 tell them something more5 

4You promised 7 tell me your history1 18 know13 12 151 
46 why 11 is 18 hate--C 6 D13 9 added 16 8 whisper1 half 
afraid 19 11 would be offended again5 

4Mine is 8 long 6 8 sad tale133 12 2 Mouse1 turning 7 
151 6 sighing5 

4It IS 8 long tail1 certainly13 12 151 looking down with 
wonder at 2 Mouse's tail; 4but why do 18 call 11 sad?3 And 
9 kept on puzzling about 11 while 2 Mouse 17 speaking1 so 
19 her idea 10 2 tale 17 something like this:-- 

4Fury 12 7 8 
mouse1 That he 
met 16 2 
house1 
"Let us 
both go 7 
law: 14 will 
prosecute 
YOU5 --Come1 
I'll take no 
denial; We 
must have 8 
trial: For 
really this 
morning I've 
nothing 
7 do5" 
Said 2 
mouse 7 2 
cur1 "Such 
8 trial1 
dear Sir1 
With 
no jury 
or judge1 
would be 
wasting 
our 
breath5" 
"I'll be 
judge1 I'll 
be jury1" 
Said 
cunning 
old Fury: 
"I'll 
try 2 
whole 
cause1 
6 
condemn 
18 
7 
death5"3 


4You are not attending133 12 2 Mouse 7 15 severely5 
4What are 18 thinking 10?3 

414 beg your pardon13 12 15 very humbly: 418 had got 7 
2 fifth bend1 14 think?3 

414 had NOT133 cried 2 Mouse1 sharply 6 very angrily5 

4A knot133 12 151 always ready 7 make herself useful1 6 
looking anxiously about her5 4Oh1 do let me help 7 undo 11133 

414 shall do nothing 10 2 sort13 12 2 Mouse1 getting up 
6 walking away5 4You insult me by talking such nonsense133 

414 didn't mean 11133 pleaded poor 155 4But you're so easily 
offended1 18 know133 

The Mouse only growled 16 reply5 

4Please come back 6 finish your story133 15 called after 
11; 6 2 others all joined 16 chorus1 4Yes1 please do133 but 
2 Mouse only shook its head impatiently1 6 walked 8 little 
quicker5 

4What 8 pity 11 wouldn't stay133 sighed 2 Lory1 20 soon 20 11 
17 quite out 10 sight; 6 an old Crab took 2 opportunity 10 
saying 7 her daughter 4Ah1 my dear13 Let this be 8 lesson 7 18 
never 7 lose YOUR temper133 4Hold your tongue1 Ma133 12 2 
young Crab1 8 little snappishly5 4You're enough 7 try 2 
patience 10 an oyster133 

414 wish 14 had our Dinah here1 14 know 14 do133 12 15 aloud1 
addressing nobody 16 particular5 4She'd soon fetch 11 back133 

4And who is Dinah1 if 14 might venture 7 ask 2 question?3 
12 2 Lory5 

15 replied eagerly1 for 9 17 always ready 7 talk about 
her pet: 4Dinah's our cat5 And she's such 8 capital one for 
catching mice 18 can't think13 And oh1 14 wish 18 could see her 
after 2 birds13 Why1 she'll eat 8 little bird 20 soon 20 look 
at 11133 

This speech caused 8 remarkable sensation among 2 party5 
Some 10 2 birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began 
wrapping itself up very carefully1 remarking1 414 really must be 
getting home; 2 night-air doesn't suit my throat133 6 8 Canary 
called out 16 8 trembling voice 7 its children1 4Come away1 my 
dears13 It's high time 18 were all 16 bed133 On various pretexts 
they all moved off1 6 15 17 soon left alone5 

414 wish 14 hadn't mentioned Dinah133 9 12 7 herself 16 8 
melancholy tone5 4Nobody seems 7 like her1 down here1 6 I'm 
sure she's 2 best cat 16 2 world13 Oh1 my dear Dinah13 14 
wonder if 14 shall ever see 18 any more133 And here poor 15 
began 7 cry again1 for 9 felt very lonely 6 low-spirited5 
In 8 little while1 however1 9 again heard 8 little pattering 10 
footsteps 16 2 distance1 6 9 looked up eagerly1 half hoping 
19 2 Mouse had changed his mind1 6 17 coming back 7 
finish his story5 



CHAPTER IV 

The Rabbit Sends 16 8 Little Bill 


It 17 2 White Rabbit1 trotting slowly back again1 6 
looking anxiously about 20 11 went1 20 if 11 had lost something; 
6 9 heard 11 muttering 7 itself 4The Duchess13 The Duchess13 
Oh my dear paws13 Oh my fur 6 whiskers13 She'll get me 
executed1 20 sure 20 ferrets are ferrets13 Where CAN 14 have 
dropped them1 14 wonder?3 15 guessed 16 8 moment 19 11 17 
looking for 2 fan 6 2 pair 10 white kid gloves1 6 9 
very good-naturedly began hunting about for them1 but they were 
nowhere 7 be seen--everything seemed 7 have changed since her 
swim 16 2 pool1 6 2 great hall1 with 2 glass table 6 
2 little door1 had vanished completely5 

Very soon 2 Rabbit noticed 151 20 9 went hunting about1 
6 called out 7 her 16 an angry tone1 4Why1 Mary Ann1 what ARE 
18 doing out here? Run home this moment1 6 fetch me 8 pair 10 
gloves 6 8 fan13 Quick1 now133 And 15 17 so much frightened 
19 9 ran off at once 16 2 direction 11 pointed 71 without 
trying 7 explain 2 mistake 11 had made5 

4He took me for his housemaid13 9 12 7 herself 20 9 ran5 
4How surprised he'll be when he finds out who 14 am13 But I'd 
better take him his fan 6 gloves--that is1 if 14 can find them53 
As 9 12 this1 9 came upon 8 neat little house1 on 2 door 
10 which 17 8 bright brass plate with 2 name 4W5 RABBIT3 
engraved upon 115 She went 16 without knocking1 6 hurried 
upstairs1 16 great fear lest 9 should meet 2 real Mary Ann1 
6 be turned out 10 2 house before 9 had found 2 fan 6 
gloves5 

4How queer 11 seems13 15 12 7 herself1 47 be going 
messages for 8 rabbit13 14 suppose Dinah'll be sending me on 
messages next133 And 9 began fancying 2 sort 10 thing 19 
would happen: 4"Miss 1513 Come here directly1 6 get ready 
for your walk13" "Coming 16 8 minute1 nurse13 But I've got 7 see 
19 2 mouse doesn't get out5" Only 14 don't think13 15 went 
on1 419 they'd let Dinah stop 16 2 house if 11 began ordering 
people about like 19133 

By this time 9 had found her way into 8 tidy little room with 
8 table 16 2 window1 6 on 11 (20 9 had hoped) 8 fan 6 two 
or three pairs 10 tiny white kid gloves: 9 took up 2 fan 6 
8 pair 10 2 gloves1 6 17 just going 7 leave 2 room1 when 
her eye fell upon 8 little bottle 19 stood near 2 looking- 
glass5 There 17 no label this time with 2 words 4DRINK ME13 
but nevertheless 9 uncorked 11 6 put 11 7 her lips5 414 know 
SOMETHING interesting is sure 7 happen13 9 12 7 herself1 
4whenever 14 eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this 
bottle does5 14 do hope it'll make me grow large again1 for 
really I'm quite tired 10 being such 8 tiny little thing133 

It did so indeed1 6 much sooner than 9 had expected: 
before 9 had drunk half 2 bottle1 9 found her head pressing 
against 2 ceiling1 6 had 7 stoop 7 save her neck from being 
broken5 She hastily put down 2 bottle1 saying 7 herself 
4That's quite enough--I hope 14 shan't grow any more--As 11 is1 14 
can't get out at 2 door--I do wish 14 hadn't drunk quite so 
much133 

Alas13 11 17 too late 7 wish 1913 She went on growing1 6 
growing1 6 very soon had 7 kneel down on 2 floor: 16 
another minute there 17 not even room for this1 6 9 tried 
2 effect 10 lying down with one elbow against 2 door1 6 2 
other arm curled round her head5 Still 9 went on growing1 61 
20 8 last resource1 9 put one arm out 10 2 window1 6 one 
foot up 2 chimney1 6 12 7 herself 4Now 14 can do no more1 
whatever happens5 What WILL become 10 me?3 

Luckily for 151 2 little magic bottle had now had its full 
effect1 6 9 grew no larger: still 11 17 very uncomfortable1 
61 20 there seemed 7 be no sort 10 chance 10 her ever getting 
out 10 2 room again1 no wonder 9 felt unhappy5 

4It 17 much pleasanter at home13 thought poor 151 4when one 
wasn't always growing larger 6 smaller1 6 being ordered about 
by mice 6 rabbits5 14 almost wish 14 hadn't gone down 19 
rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious1 18 know1 
this sort 10 life13 14 do wonder what CAN have happened 7 me13 
When 14 used 7 read fairy-tales1 14 fancied 19 kind 10 thing 
never happened1 6 now here 14 am 16 2 middle 10 one13 There 
ought 7 be 8 book written about me1 19 there ought13 And when 
14 grow up1 I'll write one--but I'm grown up now13 9 added 16 8 
sorrowful tone; 4at least there's no room 7 grow up any more 
HERE53 

4But then13 thought 151 4shall 14 NEVER get any older than 14 
am now? That'll be 8 comfort1 one way--never 7 be an old woman-- 
but then--always 7 have lessons 7 learn13 Oh1 14 shouldn't like THAT133 

4Oh1 18 foolish 15133 9 answered herself5 4How can 18 
learn lessons 16 here? Why1 there's hardly room for YOU1 6 no 
room at all for any lesson-books133 

And so 9 went on1 taking first one side 6 then 2 other1 
6 making quite 8 conversation 10 11 altogether; but after 8 few 
minutes 9 heard 8 voice outside1 6 stopped 7 listen5 

4Mary Ann13 Mary Ann133 12 2 voice5 4Fetch me my gloves 
this moment133 Then came 8 little pattering 10 feet on 2 
stairs5 15 knew 11 17 2 Rabbit coming 7 look for her1 6 
9 trembled till 9 shook 2 house1 quite forgetting 19 9 
17 now about 8 thousand times 20 large 20 2 Rabbit1 6 had no 
reason 7 be afraid 10 115 

Presently 2 Rabbit came up 7 2 door1 6 tried 7 open 11; 
but1 20 2 door opened inwards1 6 Alice's elbow 17 pressed 
hard against 111 19 attempt proved 8 failure5 15 heard 11 
say 7 itself 4Then I'll go round 6 get 16 at 2 window53 

4THAT 18 won't3 thought 151 61 after waiting till 9 
fancied 9 heard 2 Rabbit just under 2 window1 9 suddenly 
spread out her hand1 6 made 8 snatch 16 2 air5 She did not 
get hold 10 anything1 but 9 heard 8 little shriek 6 8 fall1 
6 8 crash 10 broken glass1 from which 9 concluded 19 11 17 
just possible 11 had fallen into 8 cucumber-frame1 or something 
10 2 sort5 

Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat13 Pat13 Where are 
18?3 And then 8 voice 9 had never heard before1 4Sure then 
I'm here13 Digging for apples1 yer honour133 

4Digging for apples1 indeed133 12 2 Rabbit angrily5 4Here13 
Come 6 help me out 10 THIS133 (Sounds 10 more broken glass5) 

4Now tell me1 Pat1 what's 19 16 2 window?3 

4Sure1 it's an arm1 yer honour133 (He pronounced 11 4arrum53) 

4An arm1 18 goose13 Who ever saw one 19 size? Why1 11 
fills 2 whole window133 

4Sure1 11 does1 yer honour: but it's an arm for all 1953 

4Well1 it's got no business there1 at any rate: go 6 take 11 
away133 

There 17 8 long silence after this1 6 15 could only hear 
whispers now 6 then; such 201 4Sure1 14 don't like 111 yer 
honour1 at all1 at all133 4Do 20 14 tell 181 18 coward133 6 at 
last 9 spread out her hand again1 6 made another snatch 16 
2 air5 This time there were TWO little shrieks1 6 more 
sounds 10 broken glass5 4What 8 number 10 cucumber-frames there 
must be133 thought 155 414 wonder what they'll do next13 As for 
pulling me out 10 2 window1 14 only wish they COULD13 I'm sure 14 
don't want 7 stay 16 here any longer133 

She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at 
last came 8 rumbling 10 little cartwheels1 6 2 sound 10 8 
good many voices all talking together: 9 made out 2 words: 
4Where's 2 other ladder?--Why1 14 hadn't 7 bring but one; 
Bill's got 2 other--Bill13 fetch 11 here1 lad!--Here1 put 3em up 
at this corner--No1 tie 3em together first--they don't reach half 
high enough yet--Oh13 they'll do well enough; don't be particular-- 
Here1 Bill13 catch hold 10 this rope--Will 2 roof bear?--Mind 
19 loose slate--Oh1 it's coming down13 Heads below133 (8 loud 
crash)--`Now1 who did that?--It 17 Bill1 14 fancy--Who's 7 go 
down 2 chimney?--Nay1 14 shan't13 YOU do it!--That 14 won't1 
then!--Bill's 7 go down--Here1 Bill13 2 master says you're 7 
go down 2 chimney133 

4Oh13 So Bill's got 7 come down 2 chimney1 has he?3 12 
15 7 herself5 4Shy1 they seem 7 put everything upon Bill13 
14 wouldn't be 16 Bill's place for 8 good deal: this fireplace is 
narrow1 7 be sure; but 14 THINK 14 can kick 8 little133 

She drew her foot 20 far down 2 chimney 20 9 could1 6 
waited till 9 heard 8 little animal (9 couldn't guess 10 what 
sort 11 17) scratching 6 scrambling about 16 2 chimney close 
above her: then1 saying 7 herself 4This is Bill13 9 gave one 
sharp kick1 6 waited 7 see what would happen next5 

The first thing 9 heard 17 8 general chorus 10 4There goes 
Bill133 then 2 Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him1 18 by 2 
hedge133 then silence1 6 then another confusion 10 voices--`Hold 
up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How 17 111 old fellow? 
What happened 7 18? Tell us all about 11133 

Last came 8 little feeble1 squeaking voice1 (4That's Bill13 
thought 151) 4Well1 14 hardly know--No more1 thank ye; I'm 
better now--but I'm 8 deal too flustered 7 tell you--all 14 know 
is1 something comes at me like 8 Jack-in-the-box1 6 up 14 goes 
like 8 sky-rocket133 

4So 18 did1 old fellow133 12 2 others5 

4We must burn 2 house down133 12 2 Rabbit's voice; 6 
15 called out 20 loud 20 9 could1 4If 18 do5 I'll set 
Dinah at 18133 

There 17 8 dead silence instantly1 6 15 thought 7 
herself1 414 wonder what they WILL do next13 If they had any 
sense1 they'd take 2 roof off53 After 8 minute or two1 they 
began moving about again1 6 15 heard 2 Rabbit say1 4A 
barrowful will do1 7 begin with53 

4A barrowful 10 WHAT?3 thought 15; but 9 had not long 7 
doubt1 for 2 next moment 8 shower 10 little pebbles came 
rattling 16 at 2 window1 6 some 10 them hit her 16 2 face5 
4I'll put 8 stop 7 this13 9 12 7 herself1 6 shouted out1 
4You'd better not do 19 again133 which produced another dead 
silence5 

15 noticed with some surprise 19 2 pebbles were all 
turning into little cakes 20 they lay on 2 floor1 6 8 bright 
idea came into her head5 4If 14 eat one 10 these cakes13 9 
thought1 4it's sure 7 make SOME change 16 my size; 6 20 11 
can't possibly make me larger1 11 must make me smaller1 14 
suppose53 

So 9 swallowed one 10 2 cakes1 6 17 delighted 7 find 
19 9 began shrinking directly5 As soon 20 9 17 small 
enough 7 get through 2 door1 9 ran out 10 2 house1 6 
found quite 8 crowd 10 little animals 6 birds waiting outside5 
The poor little Lizard1 Bill1 17 16 2 middle1 being held up by 
two guinea-pigs1 who were giving 11 something out 10 8 bottle5 
They all made 8 rush at 15 2 moment 9 appeared; but 9 
ran off 20 hard 20 9 could1 6 soon found herself safe 16 8 
thick wood5 

4The first thing I've got 7 do13 12 15 7 herself1 20 9 
wandered about 16 2 wood1 4is 7 grow 7 my right size again; 
6 2 second thing is 7 find my way into 19 lovely garden5 
14 think 19 will be 2 best plan53 

It sounded an excellent plan1 no doubt1 6 very neatly 6 
simply arranged; 2 only difficulty 171 19 9 had not 2 
smallest idea how 7 set about 11; 6 while 9 17 peering 
about anxiously among 2 trees1 8 little sharp bark just over 
her head made her look up 16 8 great hurry5 

An enormous puppy 17 looking down at her with large round 
eyes1 6 feebly stretching out one paw1 trying 7 touch her5 
4Poor little thing133 12 151 16 8 coaxing tone1 6 9 tried 
hard 7 whistle 7 11; but 9 17 terribly frightened all 2 
time at 2 thought 19 11 might be hungry1 16 which case 11 
would be very likely 7 eat her up 16 spite 10 all her coaxing5 

Hardly knowing what 9 did1 9 picked up 8 little bit 10 
stick1 6 held 11 out 7 2 puppy; whereupon 2 puppy jumped 
into 2 air off all its feet at once1 with 8 yelp 10 delight1 
6 rushed at 2 stick1 6 made believe 7 worry 11; then 15 
dodged behind 8 great thistle1 7 keep herself from being run 
over; 6 2 moment 9 appeared on 2 other side1 2 puppy 
made another rush at 2 stick1 6 tumbled head over heels 16 
its hurry 7 get hold 10 11; then 151 thinking 11 17 very 
like having 8 game 10 play with 8 cart-horse1 6 expecting every 
moment 7 be trampled under its feet1 ran round 2 thistle 
again; then 2 puppy began 8 series 10 short charges at 2 
stick1 running 8 very little way forwards each time 6 8 long 
way back1 6 barking hoarsely all 2 while1 till at last 11 sat 
down 8 good way off1 panting1 with its tongue hanging out 10 its 
mouth1 6 its great eyes half shut5 

This seemed 7 15 8 good opportunity for making her escape; 
so 9 set off at once1 6 ran till 9 17 quite tired 6 out 
10 breath1 6 till 2 puppy's bark sounded quite faint 16 2 
distance5 

4And yet what 8 dear little puppy 11 17133 12 151 20 9 
leant against 8 buttercup 7 rest herself1 6 fanned herself 
with one 10 2 leaves: 414 should have liked teaching 11 tricks 
very much1 if--if I'd only been 2 right size 7 do 1113 Oh 
dear13 I'd nearly forgotten 19 I've got 7 grow up again13 Let 
me see--how IS 11 7 be managed? 14 suppose 14 ought 7 eat or 
drink something or other; but 2 great question is1 what?3 

The great question certainly 171 what? 15 looked all round 
her at 2 flowers 6 2 blades 10 grass1 but 9 did not see 
anything 19 looked like 2 right thing 7 eat or drink under 
2 circumstances5 There 17 8 large mushroom growing near her1 
about 2 same height 20 herself; 6 when 9 had looked under 
111 6 on both sides 10 111 6 behind 111 11 occurred 7 her 
19 9 might 20 well look 6 see what 17 on 2 top 10 115 

She stretched herself up on tiptoe1 6 peeped over 2 edge 10 
2 mushroom1 6 her eyes immediately met those 10 8 large 
caterpillar1 19 17 sitting on 2 top with its arms folded1 
quietly smoking 8 long hookah1 6 taking not 2 smallest notice 
10 her or 10 anything else5 



CHAPTER V 

Advice from 8 Caterpillar 


The Caterpillar 6 15 looked at each other for some time 16 
silence: at last 2 Caterpillar took 2 hookah out 10 its 
mouth1 6 addressed her 16 8 languid1 sleepy voice5 

4Who are YOU?3 12 2 Caterpillar5 

This 17 not an encouraging opening for 8 conversation5 15 
replied1 rather shyly1 4I--I hardly know1 sir1 just at present-- 
at least 14 know who 14 WAS when 14 got up this morning1 but 14 think 
14 must have been changed several times since then53 

4What do 18 mean by 19?3 12 2 Caterpillar sternly5 
4Explain yourself133 

414 can't explain MYSELF1 I'm afraid1 sir3 12 151 4because 
I'm not myself1 18 see53 

414 don't see13 12 2 Caterpillar5 

4I'm afraid 14 can't put 11 more clearly13 15 replied very 
politely1 4for 14 can't understand 11 myself 7 begin with; 6 
being so many different sizes 16 8 day is very confusing53 

4It isn't13 12 2 Caterpillar5 

4Well1 perhaps 18 haven't found 11 so yet13 12 15; 4but 
when 18 have 7 turn into 8 chrysalis--you will some day1 18 
know--and then after 19 into 8 butterfly1 14 should think you'll 
feel 11 8 little queer1 won't 18?3 

4Not 8 bit13 12 2 Caterpillar5 

4Well1 perhaps your feelings may be different13 12 15; 
4all 14 know is1 11 would feel very queer 7 ME53 

4You133 12 2 Caterpillar contemptuously5 4Who are YOU?3 

Which brought them back again 7 2 beginning 10 2 
conversation5 15 felt 8 little irritated at 2 Caterpillar's 
making such VERY short remarks1 6 9 drew herself up 6 121 
very gravely1 414 think1 18 ought 7 tell me who YOU are1 first53 

4Why?3 12 2 Caterpillar5 

Here 17 another puzzling question; 6 20 15 could not 
think 10 any good reason1 6 20 2 Caterpillar seemed 7 be 16 
8 VERY unpleasant state 10 mind1 9 turned away5 

4Come back133 2 Caterpillar called after her5 4I've something 
important 7 say133 

This sounded promising1 certainly: 15 turned 6 came back 
again5 

4Keep your temper13 12 2 Caterpillar5 

4Is 19 all?3 12 151 swallowing down her anger 20 well 20 
9 could5 

4No13 12 2 Caterpillar5 

15 thought 9 might 20 well wait1 20 9 had nothing else 
7 do1 6 perhaps after all 11 might tell her something worth 
hearing5 For some minutes 11 puffed away without speaking1 but 
at last 11 unfolded its arms1 took 2 hookah out 10 its mouth 
again1 6 121 4So 18 think you're changed1 do 18?3 

4I'm afraid 14 am1 sir13 12 15; 414 can't remember things 20 
14 used--and 14 don't keep 2 same size for ten minutes together133 

4Can't remember WHAT things?3 12 2 Caterpillar5 

4Well1 I've tried 7 say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE1" but 11 
all came different133 15 replied 16 8 very melancholy voice5 

4Repeat1 "YOU ARE OLD1 FATHER WILLIAM1"3 12 2 Caterpillar5 

15 folded her hands1 6 began:-- 

4You are old1 Father William13 2 young man 121 
4And your hair has become very white; 
And yet 18 incessantly stand on your head-- 
Do 18 think1 at your age1 11 is right?3 

4In my youth13 Father William replied 7 his son1 
414 feared 11 might injure 2 brain; 
But1 now 19 I'm perfectly sure 14 have none1 
Why1 14 do 11 again 6 again53 

4You are old13 12 2 youth1 420 14 mentioned before1 
And have grown most uncommonly fat; 
Yet 18 turned 8 back-somersault 16 at 2 door-- 
Pray1 what is 2 reason 10 19?3 

4In my youth13 12 2 sage1 20 he shook his grey locks1 
414 kept all my limbs very supple 
By 2 use 10 this ointment--one shilling 2 box-- 
Allow me 7 sell 18 8 couple?3 

4You are old13 12 2 youth1 46 your jaws are too weak 
For anything tougher than suet; 
Yet 18 finished 2 goose1 with 2 bones 6 2 beak-- 
Pray how did 18 manage 7 do 11?3 

4In my youth13 12 his father1 414 took 7 2 law1 
And argued each case with my wife; 
And 2 muscular strength1 which 11 gave 7 my jaw1 
Has lasted 2 rest 10 my life53 

4You are old13 12 2 youth1 4one would hardly suppose 
That your eye 17 20 steady 20 ever; 
Yet 18 balanced an eel on 2 end 10 your nose-- 
What made 18 so awfully clever?3 

414 have answered three questions1 6 19 is enough13 
Said his father; 4don't give yourself airs13 
Do 18 think 14 can listen all day 7 such stuff? 
Be off1 or I'll kick 18 down stairs133 


4That is not 12 right13 12 2 Caterpillar5 

4Not QUITE right1 I'm afraid13 12 151 timidly; 4some 10 2 
words have got altered53 

4It is wrong from beginning 7 end13 12 2 Caterpillar 
decidedly1 6 there 17 silence for some minutes5 

The Caterpillar 17 2 first 7 speak5 

4What size do 18 want 7 be?3 11 asked5 

4Oh1 I'm not particular 20 7 size13 15 hastily replied; 
4only one doesn't like changing so often1 18 know53 

414 DON'T know13 12 2 Caterpillar5 

15 12 nothing: 9 had never been so much contradicted 16 
her life before1 6 9 felt 19 9 17 losing her temper5 

4Are 18 content now?3 12 2 Caterpillar5 

4Well1 14 should like 7 be 8 LITTLE larger1 sir1 if 18 
wouldn't mind13 12 Alice: 4three inches is such 8 wretched 
height 7 be53 

4It is 8 very good height indeed133 12 2 Caterpillar 
angrily1 rearing itself upright 20 11 spoke (11 17 exactly three 
inches high)5 

4But I'm not used 7 11133 pleaded poor 15 16 8 piteous tone5 
And 9 thought 10 herself1 414 wish 2 creatures wouldn't be so 
easily offended133 

4You'll get used 7 11 16 time13 12 2 Caterpillar; 6 11 
put 2 hookah into its mouth 6 began smoking again5 

This time 15 waited patiently until 11 chose 7 speak again5 
In 8 minute or two 2 Caterpillar took 2 hookah out 10 its 
mouth 6 yawned once or twice1 6 shook itself5 Then 11 got 
down off 2 mushroom1 6 crawled away 16 2 grass1 merely 
remarking 20 11 went1 4One side will make 18 grow taller1 6 
2 other side will make 18 grow shorter53 

4One side 10 WHAT? The other side 10 WHAT?3 thought 15 7 
herself5 

4Of 2 mushroom13 12 2 Caterpillar1 just 20 if 9 had 
asked 11 aloud; 6 16 another moment 11 17 out 10 sight5 

15 remained looking thoughtfully at 2 mushroom for 8 
minute1 trying 7 make out which were 2 two sides 10 11; 6 20 
11 17 perfectly round1 9 found this 8 very difficult question5 
However1 at last 9 stretched her arms round 11 20 far 20 they 
would go1 6 broke off 8 bit 10 2 edge with each hand5 

4And now which is which?3 9 12 7 herself1 6 nibbled 8 
little 10 2 right-hand bit 7 try 2 effect: 2 next moment 
9 felt 8 violent blow underneath her chin: 11 had struck her 
foot13 

She 17 8 good deal frightened by this very sudden change1 but 
9 felt 19 there 17 no time 7 be lost1 20 9 17 shrinking 
rapidly; so 9 set 7 work at once 7 eat some 10 2 other bit5 
Her chin 17 pressed so closely against her foot1 19 there 17 
hardly room 7 open her mouth; but 9 did 11 at last1 6 
managed 7 swallow 8 morsel 10 2 lefthand bit5 


* * * * * * * 

* * * * * *

4Come1 my head's free at last133 12 15 16 8 tone 10 
delight1 which changed into alarm 16 another moment1 when 9 
found 19 her shoulders were nowhere 7 be found: all 9 could 
see1 when 9 looked down1 17 an immense length 10 neck1 which 
seemed 7 rise like 8 stalk out 10 8 sea 10 green leaves 19 lay 
far below her5 

4What CAN all 19 green stuff be?3 12 155 4And where 
HAVE my shoulders got 7? And oh1 my poor hands1 how is 11 14 
can't see 18?3 She 17 moving them about 20 9 spoke1 but no 
result seemed 7 follow1 except 8 little shaking among 2 
distant green leaves5 

As there seemed 7 be no chance 10 getting her hands up 7 her 
head1 9 tried 7 get her head down 7 them1 6 17 delighted 
7 find 19 her neck would bend about easily 16 any direction1 
like 8 serpent5 She had just succeeded 16 curving 11 down into 8 
graceful zigzag1 6 17 going 7 dive 16 among 2 leaves1 which 
9 found 7 be nothing but 2 tops 10 2 trees under which 9 
had been wandering1 when 8 sharp hiss made her draw back 16 8 
hurry: 8 large pigeon had flown into her face1 6 17 beating 
her violently with its wings5 

4Serpent133 screamed 2 Pigeon5 

4I'm NOT 8 serpent133 12 15 indignantly5 4Let me alone133 

4Serpent1 14 say again133 repeated 2 Pigeon1 but 16 8 more 
subdued tone1 6 added with 8 kind 10 sob1 4I've tried every 
way1 6 nothing seems 7 suit them133 

414 haven't 2 least idea what you're talking about13 12 
155 

4I've tried 2 roots 10 trees1 6 I've tried banks1 6 I've 
tried hedges13 2 Pigeon went on1 without attending 7 her; 4but 
those serpents13 There's no pleasing them133 

15 17 more 6 more puzzled1 but 9 thought there 17 no 
use 16 saying anything more till 2 Pigeon had finished5 

4As if 11 wasn't trouble enough hatching 2 eggs13 12 2 
Pigeon; 4but 14 must be on 2 look-out for serpents night 6 
day13 Why1 14 haven't had 8 wink 10 sleep these three weeks133 

4I'm very sorry you've been annoyed13 12 151 who 17 
beginning 7 see its meaning5 

4And just 20 I'd taken 2 highest tree 16 2 wood13 continued 
2 Pigeon1 raising its voice 7 8 shriek1 46 just 20 14 17 
thinking 14 should be free 10 them at last1 they must needs come 
wriggling down from 2 sky13 Ugh1 Serpent133 

4But I'm NOT 8 serpent1 14 tell 18133 12 155 4I'm a--I'm 
8--3 

4Well13 WHAT are 18?3 12 2 Pigeon5 414 can see you're 
trying 7 invent something133 

4I--I'm 8 little girl13 12 151 rather doubtfully1 20 9 
remembered 2 number 10 changes 9 had gone through 19 day5 

4A likely story indeed133 12 2 Pigeon 16 8 tone 10 2 
deepest contempt5 4I've seen 8 good many little girls 16 my 
time1 but never ONE with such 8 neck 20 1913 No1 no13 You're 8 
serpent; 6 there's no use denying 115 14 suppose you'll be 
telling me next 19 18 never tasted an egg133 

414 HAVE tasted eggs1 certainly13 12 151 who 17 8 very 
truthful child; 4but little girls eat eggs quite 20 much 20 
serpents do1 18 know53 

414 don't believe 1113 12 2 Pigeon; 4but if they do1 why 
then they're 8 kind 10 serpent1 that's all 14 can say53 

This 17 such 8 new idea 7 151 19 9 17 quite silent 
for 8 minute or two1 which gave 2 Pigeon 2 opportunity 10 
adding1 4You're looking for eggs1 14 know THAT well enough; 6 
what does 11 matter 7 me whether you're 8 little girl or 8 
serpent?3 

4It matters 8 good deal 7 ME13 12 15 hastily; 4but I'm 
not looking for eggs1 20 11 happens; 6 if 14 171 14 shouldn't 
want YOURS: 14 don't like them raw53 

4Well1 be off1 then133 12 2 Pigeon 16 8 sulky tone1 20 11 
settled down again into its nest5 15 crouched down among 2 
trees 20 well 20 9 could1 for her neck kept getting entangled 
among 2 branches1 6 every now 6 then 9 had 7 stop 6 
untwist 115 After 8 while 9 remembered 19 9 still held 2 
pieces 10 mushroom 16 her hands1 6 9 set 7 work very 
carefully1 nibbling first at one 6 then at 2 other1 6 
growing sometimes taller 6 sometimes shorter1 until 9 had 
succeeded 16 bringing herself down 7 her usual height5 

It 17 so long since 9 had been anything near 2 right size1 
19 11 felt quite strange at first; but 9 got used 7 11 16 8 
few minutes1 6 began talking 7 herself1 20 usual5 4Come1 
there's half my plan done now13 How puzzling all these changes 
are13 I'm never sure what I'm going 7 be1 from one minute 7 
another13 However1 I've got back 7 my right size: 2 next 
thing is1 7 get into 19 beautiful garden--how IS 19 7 be 
done1 14 wonder?3 As 9 12 this1 9 came suddenly upon an 
open place1 with 8 little house 16 11 about four feet high5 
4Whoever lives there13 thought 151 4it'll never do 7 come 
upon them THIS size: why1 14 should frighten them out 10 their 
wits133 So 9 began nibbling at 2 righthand bit again1 6 did 
not venture 7 go near 2 house till 9 had brought herself 
down 7 nine inches high5 



CHAPTER VI 

Pig 6 Pepper 


For 8 minute or two 9 stood looking at 2 house1 6 
wondering what 7 do next1 when suddenly 8 footman 16 livery came 
running out 10 2 wood--(she considered him 7 be 8 footman 
because he 17 16 livery: otherwise1 judging by his face only1 
9 would have called him 8 fish)--and rapped loudly at 2 door 
with his knuckles5 It 17 opened by another footman 16 livery1 
with 8 round face1 6 large eyes like 8 frog; 6 both footmen1 
15 noticed1 had powdered hair 19 curled all over their 
heads5 She felt very curious 7 know what 11 17 all about1 6 
crept 8 little way out 10 2 wood 7 listen5 

The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm 8 great 
letter1 nearly 20 large 20 himself1 6 this he handed over 7 
2 other1 saying1 16 8 solemn tone1 4For 2 Duchess5 An 
invitation from 2 Queen 7 play croquet53 The Frog-Footman 
repeated1 16 2 same solemn tone1 only changing 2 order 10 2 
words 8 little1 4From 2 Queen5 An invitation for 2 Duchess 
7 play croquet53 

Then they both bowed low1 6 their curls got entangled 
together5 

15 laughed so much at this1 19 9 had 7 run back into 
2 wood for fear 10 their hearing her; 6 when 9 next peeped 
out 2 Fish-Footman 17 gone1 6 2 other 17 sitting on 2 
ground near 2 door1 staring stupidly up into 2 sky5 

15 went timidly up 7 2 door1 6 knocked5 

4There's no sort 10 use 16 knocking13 12 2 Footman1 46 
19 for two reasons5 First1 because I'm on 2 same side 10 2 
door 20 18 are; secondly1 because they're making such 8 noise 
inside1 no one could possibly hear 1853 And certainly there 17 
8 most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling 
6 sneezing1 6 every now 6 then 8 great crash1 20 if 8 dish 
or kettle had been broken 7 pieces5 

4Please1 then13 12 151 4how am 14 7 get 16?3 

4There might be some sense 16 your knocking13 2 Footman went 
on without attending 7 her1 4if we had 2 door between us5 For 
instance1 if 18 were INSIDE1 18 might knock1 6 14 could let 
18 out1 18 know53 He 17 looking up into 2 sky all 2 time 
he 17 speaking1 6 this 15 thought decidedly uncivil5 4But 
perhaps he can't help 1113 9 12 7 herself; 4his eyes are so 
VERY nearly at 2 top 10 his head5 But at any rate he might 
answer questions.--How am 14 7 get 16?3 9 repeated1 aloud5 

414 shall sit here13 2 Footman remarked1 4till tomorrow--3 

At this moment 2 door 10 2 house opened1 6 8 large plate 
came skimming out1 straight at 2 Footman's head: 11 just 
grazed his nose1 6 broke 7 pieces against one 10 2 trees 
behind him5 

4--or next day1 maybe13 2 Footman continued 16 2 same tone1 
exactly 20 if nothing had happened5 

4How am 14 7 get 16?3 asked 15 again1 16 8 louder tone5 

4ARE 18 7 get 16 at all?3 12 2 Footman5 4That's 2 
first question1 18 know53 

It 171 no doubt: only 15 did not like 7 be told so5 
4It's really dreadful13 9 muttered 7 herself1 42 way all 2 
creatures argue5 It's enough 7 drive one crazy133 

The Footman seemed 7 think this 8 good opportunity for 
repeating his remark1 with variations5 414 shall sit here13 he 
121 4on 6 off1 for days 6 days53 

4But what am 14 7 do?3 12 155 

4Anything 18 like13 12 2 Footman1 6 began whistling5 

4Oh1 there's no use 16 talking 7 him13 12 15 desperately: 
4he's perfectly idiotic133 And 9 opened 2 door 6 went 165 

The door led right into 8 large kitchen1 which 17 full 10 
smoke from one end 7 2 other: 2 Duchess 17 sitting on 8 
three-legged stool 16 2 middle1 nursing 8 baby; 2 cook 17 
leaning over 2 fire1 stirring 8 large cauldron which seemed 7 
be full 10 soup5 

4There's certainly too much pepper 16 19 soup133 15 12 7 
herself1 20 well 20 9 could for sneezing5 

There 17 certainly too much 10 11 16 2 air5 Even 2 
Duchess sneezed occasionally; 6 20 for 2 baby1 11 17 
sneezing 6 howling alternately without 8 moment's pause5 The 
only things 16 2 kitchen 19 did not sneeze1 were 2 cook1 
6 8 large cat which 17 sitting on 2 hearth 6 grinning from 
ear 7 ear5 

4Please would 18 tell me13 12 151 8 little timidly1 for 
9 17 not quite sure whether 11 17 good manners for her 7 
speak first1 4why your cat grins like 19?3 

4It's 8 Cheshire cat13 12 2 Duchess1 46 that's why5 Pig133 

She 12 2 last word with such sudden violence 19 15 
quite jumped; but 9 saw 16 another moment 19 11 17 addressed 
7 2 baby1 6 not 7 her1 so 9 took courage1 6 went on 
again:-- 

414 didn't know 19 Cheshire cats always grinned; 16 fact1 14 
didn't know 19 cats COULD grin53 

4They all can13 12 2 Duchess; 46 most 10 3em do53 

414 don't know 10 any 19 do13 15 12 very politely1 
feeling quite pleased 7 have got into 8 conversation5 

4You don't know much13 12 2 Duchess; 46 that's 8 fact53 

15 did not at all like 2 tone 10 this remark1 6 thought 
11 would be 20 well 7 introduce some other subject 10 
conversation5 While 9 17 trying 7 fix on one1 2 cook took 
2 cauldron 10 soup off 2 fire1 6 at once set 7 work 
throwing everything within her reach at 2 Duchess 6 2 baby 
--2 fire-irons came first; then followed 8 shower 10 saucepans1 
plates1 6 dishes5 The Duchess took no notice 10 them even when 
they hit her; 6 2 baby 17 howling so much already1 19 11 
17 quite impossible 7 say whether 2 blows hurt 11 or not5 

4Oh1 PLEASE mind what you're doing133 cried 151 jumping up 
6 down 16 an agony 10 terror5 4Oh1 there goes his PRECIOUS 
nose3; 20 an unusually large saucepan flew close by 111 6 very 
nearly carried 11 off5 

4If everybody minded their own business13 2 Duchess 12 16 8 
hoarse growl1 42 world would go round 8 deal faster than 11 
does53 

4Which would NOT be an advantage13 12 151 who felt very 
glad 7 get an opportunity 10 showing off 8 little 10 her 
knowledge5 4Just think 10 what work 11 would make with 2 day 
6 night13 You see 2 earth takes twenty-four hours 7 turn 
round on its axis--3 

4Talking 10 axes13 12 2 Duchess1 4chop off her head133 

15 glanced rather anxiously at 2 cook1 7 see if 9 meant 
7 take 2 hint; but 2 cook 17 busily stirring 2 soup1 6 
seemed not 7 be listening1 so 9 went on again: 4Twenty-four 
hours1 14 THINK; or is 11 twelve? 14--3 

4Oh1 don't bother ME13 12 2 Duchess; 414 never could abide 
figures133 And with 19 9 began nursing her child again1 
singing 8 sort 10 lullaby 7 11 20 9 did so1 6 giving 11 8 
violent shake at 2 end 10 every line: 

4Speak roughly 7 your little boy1 
And beat him when he sneezes: 
He only does 11 7 annoy1 
Because he knows 11 teases53 

CHORUS5 

(In which 2 cook 6 2 baby joined):-- 

4Wow13 wow13 wow133 

While 2 Duchess sang 2 second verse 10 2 song1 9 kept 
tossing 2 baby violently up 6 down1 6 2 poor little thing 
howled so1 19 15 could hardly hear 2 words:-- 

414 speak severely 7 my boy1 
14 beat him when he sneezes; 
For he can thoroughly enjoy 
The pepper when he pleases133 

CHORUS5 

4Wow13 wow13 wow133 

4Here13 18 may nurse 11 8 bit1 if 18 like133 2 Duchess 12 
7 151 flinging 2 baby at her 20 9 spoke5 414 must go 6 
get ready 7 play croquet with 2 Queen13 6 9 hurried out 10 
2 room5 The cook threw 8 frying-pan after her 20 9 went out1 
but 11 just missed her5 

15 caught 2 baby with some difficulty1 20 11 17 8 queer- 
shaped little creature1 6 held out its arms 6 legs 16 all 
directions1 4just like 8 star-fish13 thought 155 The poor 
little thing 17 snorting like 8 steam-engine when 9 caught 111 
6 kept doubling itself up 6 straightening itself out again1 
so 19 altogether1 for 2 first minute or two1 11 17 20 much 
20 9 could do 7 hold 115 

As soon 20 9 had made out 2 proper way 10 nursing 111 
(which 17 7 twist 11 up into 8 sort 10 knot1 6 then keep 
tight hold 10 its right ear 6 left foot1 so 20 7 prevent its 
undoing itself1) 9 carried 11 out into 2 open air5 4IF 14 
don't take this child away with me13 thought 151 4they're sure 
7 kill 11 16 8 day or two: wouldn't 11 be murder 7 leave 11 
behind?3 She 12 2 last words out loud1 6 2 little thing 
grunted 16 reply (11 had left off sneezing by this time)5 4Don't 
grunt13 12 15; 4that's not at all 8 proper way 10 expressing 
yourself53 

The baby grunted again1 6 15 looked very anxiously into 
its face 7 see what 17 2 matter with 115 There could be no 
doubt 19 11 had 8 VERY turn-up nose1 much more like 8 snout 
than 8 real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for 
8 baby: altogether 15 did not like 2 look 10 2 thing at 
all5 4But perhaps 11 17 only sobbing13 9 thought1 6 looked 
into its eyes again1 7 see if there were any tears5 

No1 there were no tears5 4If you're going 7 turn into 8 pig1 
my dear13 12 151 seriously1 4I'll have nothing more 7 do 
with 185 Mind now133 The poor little thing sobbed again (or 
grunted1 11 17 impossible 7 say which)1 6 they went on for 
some while 16 silence5 

15 17 just beginning 7 think 7 herself1 4Now1 what am 14 
7 do with this creature when 14 get 11 home?3 when 11 grunted 
again1 so violently1 19 9 looked down into its face 16 some 
alarm5 This time there could be NO mistake about it: 11 17 
neither more nor less than 8 pig1 6 9 felt 19 11 would be 
quite absurd for her 7 carry 11 further5 

So 9 set 2 little creature down1 6 felt quite relieved 7 
see 11 trot away quietly into 2 wood5 4If 11 had grown up13 
9 12 7 herself1 411 would have made 8 dreadfully ugly child: 
but 11 makes rather 8 handsome pig1 14 think53 And 9 began 
thinking over other children 9 knew1 who might do very well 20 
pigs1 6 17 just saying 7 herself1 4if one only knew 2 right 
way 7 change them--3 when 9 17 8 little startled by seeing 
2 Cheshire Cat sitting on 8 bough 10 8 tree 8 few yards off5 

The Cat only grinned when 11 saw 155 It looked good- 
natured1 9 thought: still 11 had VERY long claws 6 8 great 
many teeth1 so 9 felt 19 11 ought 7 be treated with respect5 

4Cheshire Puss13 9 began1 rather timidly1 20 9 did not at 
all know whether 11 would like 2 name: however1 11 only 
grinned 8 little wider5 4Come1 it's pleased so far13 thought 
151 6 9 went on5 4Would 18 tell me1 please1 which way 14 
ought 7 go from here?3 

4That depends 8 good deal on where 18 want 7 get 713 12 
2 Cat5 

414 don't much care where--3 12 155 

4Then 11 doesn't matter which way 18 go13 12 2 Cat5 

4--so long 20 14 get SOMEWHERE13 15 added 20 an explanation5 

4Oh1 you're sure 7 do 1913 12 2 Cat1 4if 18 only walk 
long enough53 

15 felt 19 this could not be denied1 so 9 tried another 
question5 4What sort 10 people live about here?3 

4In THAT direction13 2 Cat 121 waving its right paw round1 
4lives 8 Hatter: 6 16 THAT direction13 waving 2 other paw1 
4lives 8 March Hare5 Visit either 18 like: they're both mad53 

4But 14 don't want 7 go among mad people13 15 remarked5 

4Oh1 18 can't help 1913 12 2 Cat: 4we're all mad here5 
I'm mad5 You're mad53 

4How do 18 know I'm mad?3 12 155 

4You must be13 12 2 Cat1 4or 18 wouldn't have come here53 

15 didn't think 19 proved 11 at all; however1 9 went on 
4And how do 18 know 19 you're mad?3 

4To begin with13 12 2 Cat1 48 dog's not mad5 You grant 
19?3 

414 suppose so13 12 155 

4Well1 then13 2 Cat went on1 418 see1 8 dog growls when it's 
angry1 6 wags its tail when it's pleased5 Now 14 growl when I'm 
pleased1 6 wag my tail when I'm angry5 Therefore I'm mad53 

414 call 11 purring1 not growling13 12 155 

4Call 11 what 18 like13 12 2 Cat5 4Do 18 play croquet 
with 2 Queen to-day?3 

414 should like 11 very much13 12 151 4but 14 haven't been 
invited yet53 

4You'll see me there13 12 2 Cat1 6 vanished5 

15 17 not much surprised at this1 9 17 getting so used 
7 queer things happening5 While 9 17 looking at 2 place 
where 11 had been1 11 suddenly appeared again5 

4By-the-bye1 what became 10 2 baby?3 12 2 Cat5 4I'd 
nearly forgotten 7 ask53 

4It turned into 8 pig13 15 quietly 121 just 20 if 11 had 
come back 16 8 natural way5 

414 thought 11 would13 12 2 Cat1 6 vanished again5 

15 waited 8 little1 half expecting 7 see 11 again1 but 11 
did not appear1 6 after 8 minute or two 9 walked on 16 2 
direction 16 which 2 March Hare 17 12 7 live5 4I've seen 
hatters before13 9 12 7 herself; 42 March Hare will be 
much 2 most interesting1 6 perhaps 20 this is May 11 won't be 
raving mad--at least not so mad 20 11 17 16 March53 As 9 12 
this1 9 looked up1 6 there 17 2 Cat again1 sitting on 8 
branch 10 8 tree5 

4Did 18 say pig1 or fig?3 12 2 Cat5 

414 12 pig13 replied 15; 46 14 wish 18 wouldn't keep 
appearing 6 vanishing so suddenly: 18 make one quite giddy53 

4All right13 12 2 Cat; 6 this time 11 vanished quite slowly1 
beginning with 2 end 10 2 tail1 6 ending with 2 grin1 
which remained some time after 2 rest 10 11 had gone5 

4Well13 I've often seen 8 cat without 8 grin13 thought 15; 
4but 8 grin without 8 cat13 It's 2 most curious thing 14 ever 
saw 16 my life133 

She had not gone much farther before 9 came 16 sight 10 2 
house 10 2 March Hare: 9 thought 11 must be 2 right house1 
because 2 chimneys were shaped like ears 6 2 roof 17 
thatched with fur5 It 17 so large 8 house1 19 9 did not 
like 7 go nearer till 9 had nibbled some more 10 2 lefthand 
bit 10 mushroom1 6 raised herself 7 about two feet high: even 
then 9 walked up towards 11 rather timidly1 saying 7 herself 
4Suppose 11 should be raving mad after all13 14 almost wish I'd 
gone 7 see 2 Hatter instead133 



CHAPTER VII 

A Mad Tea-Party 


There 17 8 table set out under 8 tree 16 front 10 2 house1 
6 2 March Hare 6 2 Hatter were having tea at it: 8 
Dormouse 17 sitting between them1 fast asleep1 6 2 other two 
were using 11 20 8 cushion1 resting their elbows on 111 6 talking 
over its head5 4Very uncomfortable for 2 Dormouse13 thought 15; 
4only1 20 it's asleep1 14 suppose 11 doesn't mind53 

The table 17 8 large one1 but 2 three were all crowded 
together at one corner 10 it: 4No room13 No room133 they cried 
out when they saw 15 coming5 4There's PLENTY 10 room133 12 
15 indignantly1 6 9 sat down 16 8 large arm-chair at one 
end 10 2 table5 

4Have some wine13 2 March Hare 12 16 an encouraging tone5 

15 looked all round 2 table1 but there 17 nothing on 11 
but tea5 414 don't see any wine13 9 remarked5 

4There isn't any13 12 2 March Hare5 

4Then 11 wasn't very civil 10 18 7 offer 1113 12 15 
angrily5 

4It wasn't very civil 10 18 7 sit down without being 
invited13 12 2 March Hare5 

414 didn't know 11 17 YOUR table13 12 15; 4it's laid for 8 
great many more than three53 

4Your hair wants cutting13 12 2 Hatter5 He had been 
looking at 15 for some time with great curiosity1 6 this 17 
his first speech5 

4You should learn not 7 make personal remarks13 15 12 
with some severity; 4it's very rude53 

The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all 
he SAID 171 4Why is 8 raven like 8 writing-desk?3 

4Come1 we shall have some fun now133 thought 155 4I'm glad 
they've begun asking riddles.--I believe 14 can guess 1913 9 
added aloud5 

4Do 18 mean 19 18 think 18 can find out 2 answer 7 11?3 
12 2 March Hare5 

4Exactly so13 12 155 

4Then 18 should say what 18 mean13 2 March Hare went on5 

414 do13 15 hastily replied; 4at least--at least 14 mean what 
14 say--that's 2 same thing1 18 know53 

4Not 2 same thing 8 bit133 12 2 Hatter5 4You might just 
20 well say 19 "14 see what 14 eat" is 2 same thing 20 "14 eat 
what 14 see"133 

4You might just 20 well say13 added 2 March Hare1 419 "14 
like what 14 get" is 2 same thing 20 "14 get what 14 like"133 

4You might just 20 well say13 added 2 Dormouse1 who seemed 7 
be talking 16 his sleep1 419 "14 breathe when 14 sleep" is 2 
same thing 20 "14 sleep when 14 breathe"133 

4It IS 2 same thing with 1813 12 2 Hatter1 6 here 2 
conversation dropped1 6 2 party sat silent for 8 minute1 
while 15 thought over all 9 could remember about ravens 6 
writing-desks1 which wasn't much5 

The Hatter 17 2 first 7 break 2 silence5 4What day 10 
2 month is 11?3 he 121 turning 7 Alice: he had taken his 
watch out 10 his pocket1 6 17 looking at 11 uneasily1 shaking 
11 every now 6 then1 6 holding 11 7 his ear5 

15 considered 8 little1 6 then 12 4The fourth53 

4Two days wrong133 sighed 2 Hatter5 414 told 18 butter 
wouldn't suit 2 works133 he added looking angrily at 2 March 
Hare5 

4It 17 2 BEST butter13 2 March Hare meekly replied5 

4Yes1 but some crumbs must have got 16 20 well13 2 Hatter 
grumbled: 418 shouldn't have put 11 16 with 2 bread-knife53 

The March Hare took 2 watch 6 looked at 11 gloomily: then 
he dipped 11 into his cup 10 tea1 6 looked at 11 again: but he 
could think 10 nothing better 7 say than his first remark1 4It 
17 2 BEST butter1 18 know53 

15 had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity5 
4What 8 funny watch133 9 remarked5 4It tells 2 day 10 2 
month1 6 doesn't tell what o'clock 11 is133 

4Why should 11?3 muttered 2 Hatter5 4Does YOUR watch tell 
18 what year 11 is?3 

4Of course not13 15 replied very readily: 4but that's 
because 11 stays 2 same year for such 8 long time together53 

4Which is just 2 case with MINE13 12 2 Hatter5 

15 felt dreadfully puzzled5 The Hatter's remark seemed 7 
have no sort 10 meaning 16 111 6 yet 11 17 certainly English5 
414 don't quite understand 1813 9 121 20 politely 20 9 
could5 

4The Dormouse is asleep again13 12 2 Hatter1 6 he poured 
8 little hot tea upon its nose5 

The Dormouse shook its head impatiently1 6 121 without 
opening its eyes1 4Of course1 10 course; just what 14 17 going 7 
remark myself53 

4Have 18 guessed 2 riddle yet?3 2 Hatter 121 turning 7 
15 again5 

4No1 14 give 11 up13 15 replied: 4what's 2 answer?3 

414 haven't 2 slightest idea13 12 2 Hatter5 

4Nor 1413 12 2 March Hare5 

15 sighed wearily5 414 think 18 might do something better 
with 2 time13 9 121 4than waste 11 16 asking riddles 19 
have no answers53 

4If 18 knew Time 20 well 20 14 do13 12 2 Hatter1 418 
wouldn't talk about wasting IT5 It's HIM53 

414 don't know what 18 mean13 12 155 

4Of course 18 don't133 2 Hatter 121 tossing his head 
contemptuously5 414 dare say 18 never even spoke 7 Time133 

4Perhaps not13 15 cautiously replied: 4but 14 know 14 have 7 
beat time when 14 learn music53 

4Ah13 19 accounts for 1113 12 2 Hatter5 4He won't stand 
beating5 Now1 if 18 only kept on good terms with him1 he'd do 
almost anything 18 liked with 2 clock5 For instance1 suppose 
11 were nine o'clock 16 2 morning1 just time 7 begin lessons: 
you'd only have 7 whisper 8 hint 7 Time1 6 round goes 2 
clock 16 8 twinkling13 Half-past one1 time for dinner133 

(414 only wish 11 1713 2 March Hare 12 7 itself 16 8 
whisper5) 

4That would be grand1 certainly13 12 15 thoughtfully: 
4but then--I shouldn't be hungry for 111 18 know53 

4Not at first1 perhaps13 12 2 Hatter: 4but 18 could keep 
11 7 half-past one 20 long 20 18 liked53 

4Is 19 2 way YOU manage?3 15 asked5 

The Hatter shook his head mournfully5 4Not 14133 he replied5 
4We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad1 18 know--3 
(pointing with his tea spoon at 2 March Hare1) 4--11 17 at 2 
great concert given by 2 Queen 10 Hearts1 6 14 had 7 sing 

"Twinkle1 twinkle1 little bat13 
How 14 wonder what you're at13" 

You know 2 song1 perhaps?3 

4I've heard something like 1113 12 155 

4It goes on1 18 know13 2 Hatter continued1 416 this way:-- 

"Up above 2 world 18 fly1 
Like 8 tea-tray 16 2 sky5 
Twinkle1 twinkle--"3 

Here 2 Dormouse shook itself1 6 began singing 16 its sleep 
4Twinkle1 twinkle1 twinkle1 twinkle--3 6 went on so long 19 
they had 7 pinch 11 7 make 11 stop5 

4Well1 I'd hardly finished 2 first verse13 12 2 Hatter1 
4when 2 Queen jumped up 6 bawled out1 "He's murdering 2 
time13 Off with his head13"3 

4How dreadfully savage133 exclaimed 155 

4And ever since 1913 2 Hatter went on 16 8 mournful tone1 
4he won't do 8 thing 14 ask13 It's always six o'clock now53 

A bright idea came into Alice's head5 4Is 19 2 reason so 
many tea-things are put out here?3 9 asked5 

4Yes1 that's 1113 12 2 Hatter with 8 sigh: 4it's always 
tea-time1 6 we've no time 7 wash 2 things between whiles53 

4Then 18 keep moving round1 14 suppose?3 12 155 

4Exactly so13 12 2 Hatter: 420 2 things get used up53 

4But what happens when 18 come 7 2 beginning again?3 15 
ventured 7 ask5 

4Suppose we change 2 subject13 2 March Hare interrupted1 
yawning5 4I'm getting tired 10 this5 14 vote 2 young lady 
tells us 8 story53 

4I'm afraid 14 don't know one13 12 151 rather alarmed at 
2 proposal5 

4Then 2 Dormouse shall133 they both cried5 4Wake up1 
Dormouse133 And they pinched 11 on both sides at once5 

The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes5 414 wasn't asleep13 he 
12 16 8 hoarse1 feeble voice: 414 heard every word 18 fellows 
were saying53 

4Tell us 8 story133 12 2 March Hare5 

4Yes1 please do133 pleaded 155 

4And be quick about 1113 added 2 Hatter1 4or you'll be asleep 
again before it's done53 

4Once upon 8 time there were three little sisters13 2 
Dormouse began 16 8 great hurry; 46 their names were Elsie1 
Lacie1 6 Tillie; 6 they lived at 2 bottom 10 8 well--3 

4What did they live on?3 12 151 who always took 8 great 
interest 16 questions 10 eating 6 drinking5 

4They lived on treacle13 12 2 Dormouse1 after thinking 8 
minute or two5 

4They couldn't have done 191 18 know13 15 gently 
remarked; 4they'd have been ill53 

4So they were13 12 2 Dormouse; 4VERY ill53 

15 tried 7 fancy 7 herself what such an extraordinary ways 
10 living would be like1 but 11 puzzled her too much1 so 9 went 
on: 4But why did they live at 2 bottom 10 8 well?3 

4Take some more tea13 2 March Hare 12 7 151 very 
earnestly5 

4I've had nothing yet13 15 replied 16 an offended tone1 4so 
14 can't take more53 

4You mean 18 can't take LESS13 12 2 Hatter: 4it's very 
easy 7 take MORE than nothing53 

4Nobody asked YOUR opinion13 12 155 

4Who's making personal remarks now?3 2 Hatter asked 
triumphantly5 

15 did not quite know what 7 say 7 this: so 9 helped 
herself 7 some tea 6 bread-and-butter1 6 then turned 7 2 
Dormouse1 6 repeated her question5 4Why did they live at 2 
bottom 10 8 well?3 

The Dormouse again took 8 minute or two 7 think about 111 6 
then 121 4It 17 8 treacle-well53 

4There's no such thing133 15 17 beginning very angrily1 but 
2 Hatter 6 2 March Hare went 4Sh13 sh133 6 2 Dormouse 
sulkily remarked1 4If 18 can't be civil1 you'd better finish 2 
story for yourself53 

4No1 please go on133 15 12 very humbly; 414 won't interrupt 
again5 14 dare say there may be ONE53 

4One1 indeed133 12 2 Dormouse indignantly5 However1 he 
consented 7 go on5 4And so these three little sisters--they 
were learning 7 draw1 18 know--3 

4What did they draw?3 12 151 quite forgetting her promise5 

4Treacle13 12 2 Dormouse1 without considering at all this 
time5 

414 want 8 clean cup13 interrupted 2 Hatter: 4let's all move 
one place on53 

He moved on 20 he spoke1 6 2 Dormouse followed him: 2 
March Hare moved into 2 Dormouse's place1 6 15 rather 
unwillingly took 2 place 10 2 March Hare5 The Hatter 17 2 
only one who got any advantage from 2 change: 6 15 17 8 
good deal worse off than before1 20 2 March Hare had just upset 
2 milk-jug into his plate5 

15 did not wish 7 offend 2 Dormouse again1 so 9 began 
very cautiously: 4But 14 don't understand5 Where did they draw 
2 treacle from?3 

4You can draw water out 10 8 water-well13 12 2 Hatter; 4so 
14 should think 18 could draw treacle out 10 8 treacle-well--eh1 
stupid?3 

4But they were IN 2 well13 15 12 7 2 Dormouse1 not 
choosing 7 notice this last remark5 

4Of course they were31 12 2 Dormouse; 4--well 1653 

This answer so confused poor 151 19 9 let 2 Dormouse 
go on for some time without interrupting 115 

4They were learning 7 draw13 2 Dormouse went on1 yawning 6 
rubbing its eyes1 for 11 17 getting very sleepy; 46 they drew 
all manner 10 things--everything 19 begins with an M--3 

4Why with an M?3 12 155 

4Why not?3 12 2 March Hare5 

15 17 silent5 

The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time1 6 17 going 
off into 8 doze; but1 on being pinched by 2 Hatter1 11 woke up 
again with 8 little shriek1 6 went on: 4--19 begins with an 
M1 such 20 mouse-traps1 6 2 moon1 6 memory1 6 muchness-- 
18 know 18 say things are "much 10 8 muchness"--did 18 ever 
see such 8 thing 20 8 drawing 10 8 muchness?3 

4Really1 now 18 ask me13 12 151 very much confused1 414 
don't think--3 

4Then 18 shouldn't talk13 12 2 Hatter5 

This piece 10 rudeness 17 more than 15 could bear: 9 got 
up 16 great disgust1 6 walked off; 2 Dormouse fell asleep 
instantly1 6 neither 10 2 others took 2 least notice 10 her 
going1 though 9 looked back once or twice1 half hoping 19 
they would call after her: 2 last time 9 saw them1 they were 
trying 7 put 2 Dormouse into 2 teapot5 

4At any rate I'll never go THERE again133 12 15 20 9 
picked her way through 2 wood5 4It's 2 stupidest tea-party 14 
ever 17 at 16 all my life133 

Just 20 9 12 this1 9 noticed 19 one 10 2 trees had 8 
door leading right into 115 4That's very curious133 9 thought5 
4But everything's curious today5 14 think 14 may 20 well go 16 at once53 
And 16 9 went5 

Once more 9 found herself 16 2 long hall1 6 close 7 2 
little glass table5 4Now1 I'll manage better this time13 
9 12 7 herself1 6 began by taking 2 little golden key1 
6 unlocking 2 door 19 led into 2 garden5 Then 9 went 
7 work nibbling at 2 mushroom (9 had kept 8 piece 10 11 
16 her pocket) till 9 17 about 8 foot high: then 9 walked down 
2 little passage: 6 THEN--she found herself at last 16 2 
beautiful garden1 among 2 bright flower-beds 6 2 cool fountains5 



CHAPTER VIII 

The Queen's Croquet-Ground 


A large rose-tree stood near 2 entrance 10 2 garden: 2 
roses growing on 11 were white1 but there were three gardeners at 
111 busily painting them red5 15 thought this 8 very curious 
thing1 6 9 went nearer 7 watch them1 6 just 20 9 came up 
7 them 9 heard one 10 them say1 4Look out now1 Five13 Don't go 
splashing paint over me like 19133 

414 couldn't help 1113 12 Five1 16 8 sulky tone; 4Seven jogged 
my elbow53 

On which Seven looked up 6 121 4That's right1 Five13 Always 
lay 2 blame on others133 

4YOU'D better not talk133 12 Five5 414 heard 2 Queen say only 
yesterday 18 deserved 7 be beheaded133 

4What for?3 12 2 one who had spoken first5 

4That's none 10 YOUR business1 Two133 12 Seven5 

4Yes1 11 IS his business133 12 Five1 46 I'll tell him--it 
17 for bringing 2 cook tulip-roots instead 10 onions53 

Seven flung down his brush1 6 had just begun 4Well1 10 all 
2 unjust things--3 when his eye chanced 7 fall upon 151 20 
9 stood watching them1 6 he checked himself suddenly: 2 
others looked round also1 6 all 10 them bowed low5 

4Would 18 tell me13 12 151 8 little timidly1 4why 18 are 
painting those roses?3 

Five 6 Seven 12 nothing1 but looked at Two5 Two began 16 8 
low voice1 4Why 2 fact is1 18 see1 Miss1 this here ought 7 
have been 8 RED rose-tree1 6 we put 8 white one 16 by mistake; 
6 if 2 Queen 17 7 find 11 out1 we should all have our heads 
cut off1 18 know5 So 18 see1 Miss1 we're doing our best1 afore 
9 comes1 7--3 At this moment Five1 who had been anxiously 
looking across 2 garden1 called out 4The Queen13 The Queen133 
6 2 three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon 
their faces5 There 17 8 sound 10 many footsteps1 6 15 
looked round1 eager 7 see 2 Queen5 

First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped 
like 2 three gardeners1 oblong 6 flat1 with their hands 6 
feet at 2 corners: next 2 ten courtiers; these were 
ornamented all over with diamonds1 6 walked two 6 two1 20 2 
soldiers did5 After these came 2 royal children; there were 
ten 10 them1 6 2 little dears came jumping merrily along hand 
16 hand1 16 couples: they were all ornamented with hearts5 Next 
came 2 guests1 mostly Kings 6 Queens1 6 among them 15 
recognised 2 White Rabbit: 11 17 talking 16 8 hurried nervous 
manner1 smiling at everything 19 17 121 6 went by without 
noticing her5 Then followed 2 Knave 10 Hearts1 carrying 2 
King's crown on 8 crimson velvet cushion; 61 last 10 all this 
grand procession1 came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS5 

15 17 rather doubtful whether 9 ought not 7 lie down on 
her face like 2 three gardeners1 but 9 could not remember 
ever having heard 10 such 8 rule at processions; 46 besides1 
what would be 2 use 10 8 procession13 thought 91 4if people 
had all 7 lie down upon their faces1 so 19 they couldn't see 11?3 
So 9 stood still where 9 171 6 waited5 

When 2 procession came opposite 7 151 they all stopped 
6 looked at her1 6 2 Queen 12 severely 4Who is this?3 
She 12 11 7 2 Knave 10 Hearts1 who only bowed 6 smiled 16 reply5 

4Idiot133 12 2 Queen1 tossing her head impatiently; 61 
turning 7 151 9 went on1 4What's your name1 child?3 

4My name is 151 so please your Majesty13 12 15 very 
politely; but 9 added1 7 herself1 4Why1 they're only 8 pack 10 
cards1 after all5 14 needn't be afraid 10 them133 

4And who are THESE?3 12 2 Queen1 pointing 7 2 three 
gardeners who were lying round 2 rosetree; for1 18 see1 20 
they were lying on their faces1 6 2 pattern on their backs 
17 2 same 20 2 rest 10 2 pack1 9 could not tell whether 
they were gardeners1 or soldiers1 or courtiers1 or three 10 her 
own children5 

4How should 14 know?3 12 151 surprised at her own courage5 
4It's no business 10 MINE53 

The Queen turned crimson with fury1 61 after glaring at her 
for 8 moment like 8 wild beast1 screamed 4Off with her head13 
Off--3 

4Nonsense133 12 151 very loudly 6 decidedly1 6 2 
Queen 17 silent5 

The King laid his hand upon her arm1 6 timidly 12 
4Consider1 my dear: 9 is only 8 child133 

The Queen turned angrily away from him1 6 12 7 2 Knave 
4Turn them over133 

The Knave did so1 very carefully1 with one foot5 

4Get up133 12 2 Queen1 16 8 shrill1 loud voice1 6 2 
three gardeners instantly jumped up1 6 began bowing 7 2 
King1 2 Queen1 2 royal children1 6 everybody else5 

4Leave off 19133 screamed 2 Queen5 4You make me giddy53 
And then1 turning 7 2 rose-tree1 9 went on1 4What HAVE 18 
been doing here?3 

4May 11 please your Majesty13 12 Two1 16 8 very humble tone1 
going down on one knee 20 he spoke1 4we were trying--3 

414 see133 12 2 Queen1 who had meanwhile been examining 2 
roses5 4Off with their heads133 6 2 procession moved on1 
three 10 2 soldiers remaining behind 7 execute 2 unfortunate 
gardeners1 who ran 7 15 for protection5 

4You shan't be beheaded133 12 151 6 9 put them into 8 
large flower-pot 19 stood near5 The three soldiers wandered 
about for 8 minute or two1 looking for them1 6 then quietly 
marched off after 2 others5 

4Are their heads off?3 shouted 2 Queen5 

4Their heads are gone1 if 11 please your Majesty133 2 soldiers 
shouted 16 reply5 

4That's right133 shouted 2 Queen5 4Can 18 play croquet?3 

The soldiers were silent1 6 looked at 151 20 2 question 
17 evidently meant for her5 

4Yes133 shouted 155 

4Come on1 then133 roared 2 Queen1 6 15 joined 2 
procession1 wondering very much what would happen next5 

4It's--it's 8 very fine day133 12 8 timid voice at her side5 
She 17 walking by 2 White Rabbit1 who 17 peeping anxiously 
into her face5 

4Very13 12 Alice: 4--where's 2 Duchess?3 

4Hush13 Hush133 12 2 Rabbit 16 8 low1 hurried tone5 He 
looked anxiously over his shoulder 20 he spoke1 6 then raised 
himself upon tiptoe1 put his mouth close 7 her ear1 6 
whispered 4She's under sentence 10 execution53 

4What for?3 12 155 

4Did 18 say "What 8 pity13"?3 2 Rabbit asked5 

4No1 14 didn't13 12 Alice: 414 don't think it's at all 8 pity5 
14 12 "What for?"3 

4She boxed 2 Queen's ears--3 2 Rabbit began5 15 gave 8 
little scream 10 laughter5 4Oh1 hush133 2 Rabbit whispered 16 8 
frightened tone5 4The Queen will hear 1813 You see1 9 came 
rather late1 6 2 Queen 12--3 

4Get 7 your places133 shouted 2 Queen 16 8 voice 10 thunder1 
6 people began running about 16 all directions1 tumbling up 
against each other; however1 they got settled down 16 8 minute or 
two1 6 2 game began5 15 thought 9 had never seen such 8 
curious croquet-ground 16 her life; 11 17 all ridges 6 
furrows; 2 balls were live hedgehogs1 2 mallets live 
flamingoes1 6 2 soldiers had 7 double themselves up 6 7 
stand on their hands 6 feet1 7 make 2 arches5 

The chief difficulty 15 found at first 17 16 managing her 
flamingo: 9 succeeded 16 getting its body tucked away1 
comfortably enough1 under her arm1 with its legs hanging down1 
but generally1 just 20 9 had got its neck nicely straightened 
out1 6 17 going 7 give 2 hedgehog 8 blow with its head1 11 
WOULD twist itself round 6 look up 16 her face1 with such 8 
puzzled expression 19 9 could not help bursting out laughing: 
6 when 9 had got its head down1 6 17 going 7 begin again1 
11 17 very provoking 7 find 19 2 hedgehog had unrolled 
itself1 6 17 16 2 act 10 crawling away: besides all this1 
there 17 generally 8 ridge or furrow 16 2 way wherever 9 
wanted 7 send 2 hedgehog 71 61 20 2 doubled-up soldiers 
were always getting up 6 walking off 7 other parts 10 2 
ground1 15 soon came 7 2 conclusion 19 11 17 8 very 
difficult game indeed5 

The players all played at once without waiting for turns1 
quarrelling all 2 while1 6 fighting for 2 hedgehogs; 6 16 
8 very short time 2 Queen 17 16 8 furious passion1 6 went 
stamping about1 6 shouting 4Off with his head133 or 4Off with 
her head133 about once 16 8 minute5 

15 began 7 feel very uneasy: 7 be sure1 9 had not 20 
yet had any dispute with 2 Queen1 but 9 knew 19 11 might 
happen any minute1 46 then13 thought 91 4what would become 10 
me? They're dreadfully fond 10 beheading people here; 2 great 
wonder is1 19 there's any one left alive133 

She 17 looking about for some way 10 escape1 6 wondering 
whether 9 could get away without being seen1 when 9 noticed 8 
curious appearance 16 2 air: 11 puzzled her very much at 
first1 but1 after watching 11 8 minute or two1 9 made 11 out 7 
be 8 grin1 6 9 12 7 herself 4It's 2 Cheshire Cat: now 14 
shall have somebody 7 talk 753 

4How are 18 getting on?3 12 2 Cat1 20 soon 20 there 17 
mouth enough for 11 7 speak with5 

15 waited till 2 eyes appeared1 6 then nodded5 4It's no 
use speaking 7 1113 9 thought1 4till its ears have come1 or at 
least one 10 them53 In another minute 2 whole head appeared1 
6 then 15 put down her flamingo1 6 began an account 10 2 
game1 feeling very glad 9 had someone 7 listen 7 her5 The 
Cat seemed 7 think 19 there 17 enough 10 11 now 16 sight1 6 
no more 10 11 appeared5 

414 don't think they play at all fairly13 15 began1 16 rather 
8 complaining tone1 46 they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't 
hear oneself speak--and they don't seem 7 have any rules 16 
particular; at least1 if there are1 nobody attends 7 them--and 
you've no idea how confusing 11 is all 2 things being alive; 
for instance1 there's 2 arch I've got 7 go through next 
walking about at 2 other end 10 2 ground--and 14 should have 
croqueted 2 Queen's hedgehog just now1 only 11 ran away when 11 
saw mine coming133 

4How do 18 like 2 Queen?3 12 2 Cat 16 8 low voice5 

4Not at all13 12 Alice: 4she's so extremely--3 Just then 
9 noticed 19 2 Queen 17 close behind her1 listening: so 
9 went on1 4--likely 7 win1 19 it's hardly worth while 
finishing 2 game53 

The Queen smiled 6 passed on5 

4Who ARE 18 talking 7?3 12 2 King1 going up 7 151 6 
looking at 2 Cat's head with great curiosity5 

4It's 8 friend 10 mine--a Cheshire Cat13 12 Alice: 4allow me 
7 introduce 1153 

414 don't like 2 look 10 11 at all13 12 2 King: 
4however1 11 may kiss my hand if 11 likes53 

4I'd rather not13 2 Cat remarked5 

4Don't be impertinent13 12 2 King1 46 don't look at me 
like 19133 He got behind 15 20 he spoke5 

4A cat may look at 8 king13 12 155 4I've read 19 16 
some book1 but 14 don't remember where53 

4Well1 11 must be removed13 12 2 King very decidedly1 6 
he called 2 Queen1 who 17 passing at 2 moment1 4My dear13 14 
wish 18 would have this cat removed133 

The Queen had only one way 10 settling all difficulties1 great 
or small5 4Off with his head133 9 121 without even looking 
round5 

4I'll fetch 2 executioner myself13 12 2 King eagerly1 6 
he hurried off5 

15 thought 9 might 20 well go back1 6 see how 2 game 
17 going on1 20 9 heard 2 Queen's voice 16 2 distance1 
screaming with passion5 She had already heard her sentence three 
10 2 players 7 be executed for having missed their turns1 6 
9 did not like 2 look 10 things at all1 20 2 game 17 16 
such confusion 19 9 never knew whether 11 17 her turn or 
not5 So 9 went 16 search 10 her hedgehog5 

The hedgehog 17 engaged 16 8 fight with another hedgehog1 
which seemed 7 15 an excellent opportunity for croqueting one 
10 them with 2 other: 2 only difficulty 171 19 her 
flamingo 17 gone across 7 2 other side 10 2 garden1 where 
15 could see 11 trying 16 8 helpless sort 10 way 7 fly up 
into 8 tree5 

By 2 time 9 had caught 2 flamingo 6 brought 11 back1 
2 fight 17 over1 6 both 2 hedgehogs were out 10 sight: 
4but 11 doesn't matter much13 thought 151 420 all 2 arches 
are gone from this side 10 2 ground53 So 9 tucked 11 away 
under her arm1 19 11 might not escape again1 6 went back for 
8 little more conversation with her friend5 

When 9 got back 7 2 Cheshire Cat1 9 17 surprised 7 
find quite 8 large crowd collected round it: there 17 8 dispute 
going on between 2 executioner1 2 King1 6 2 Queen1 who 
were all talking at once1 while all 2 rest were quite silent1 
6 looked very uncomfortable5 

The moment 15 appeared1 9 17 appealed 7 by all three 7 
settle 2 question1 6 they repeated their arguments 7 her1 
though1 20 they all spoke at once1 9 found 11 very hard indeed 
7 make out exactly what they 125 

The executioner's argument 171 19 18 couldn't cut off 8 
head unless there 17 8 body 7 cut 11 off from: 19 he had 
never had 7 do such 8 thing before1 6 he wasn't going 7 begin 
at HIS time 10 life5 

The King's argument 171 19 anything 19 had 8 head could be 
beheaded1 6 19 18 weren't 7 talk nonsense5 

The Queen's argument 171 19 if something wasn't done about 
11 16 less than no time she'd have everybody executed1 all round5 
(It 17 this last remark 19 had made 2 whole party look so 
grave 6 anxious5) 

15 could think 10 nothing else 7 say but 4It belongs 7 2 
Duchess: you'd better ask HER about 1153 

4She's 16 prison13 2 Queen 12 7 2 executioner: 4fetch 
her here53 And 2 executioner went off like an arrow5 

The Cat's head began fading away 2 moment he 17 gone1 61 
by 2 time he had come back with 2 Duchess1 11 had entirely 
disappeared; so 2 King 6 2 executioner ran wildly up 6 down 
looking for 111 while 2 rest 10 2 party went back 7 2 game5 



CHAPTER IX 

The Mock Turtle's Story 


4You can't think how glad 14 am 7 see 18 again1 18 dear old 
thing133 12 2 Duchess1 20 9 tucked her arm affectionately 
into Alice's1 6 they walked off together5 

15 17 very glad 7 find her 16 such 8 pleasant temper1 6 
thought 7 herself 19 perhaps 11 17 only 2 pepper 19 had 
made her so savage when they met 16 2 kitchen5 

4When I'M 8 Duchess13 9 12 7 herself1 (not 16 8 very 
hopeful tone though)1 414 won't have any pepper 16 my kitchen AT 
ALL5 Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper 19 
makes people hot-tempered13 9 went on1 very much pleased at 
having found out 8 new kind 10 rule1 46 vinegar 19 makes them 
sour--and camomile 19 makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar 
6 such things 19 make children sweet-tempered5 14 only wish 
people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about 111 18 
know--3 

She had quite forgotten 2 Duchess by this time1 6 17 8 
little startled when 9 heard her voice close 7 her ear5 
4You're thinking about something1 my dear1 6 19 makes 18 
forget 7 talk5 14 can't tell 18 just now what 2 moral 10 19 
is1 but 14 shall remember 11 16 8 bit53 

4Perhaps 11 hasn't one13 15 ventured 7 remark5 

4Tut1 tut1 child133 12 2 Duchess5 4Everything's got 8 
moral1 if only 18 can find 1153 And 9 squeezed herself up 
closer 7 Alice's side 20 9 spoke5 

15 did not much like keeping so close 7 her: first1 
because 2 Duchess 17 VERY ugly; 6 secondly1 because 9 17 
exactly 2 right height 7 rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder1 
6 11 17 an uncomfortably sharp chin5 However1 9 did not 
like 7 be rude1 so 9 bore 11 20 well 20 9 could5 

4The game's going on rather better now13 9 121 by way 10 
keeping up 2 conversation 8 little5 

43Tis so13 12 2 Duchess: 46 2 moral 10 19 is--"Oh1 
3tis love1 3tis love1 19 makes 2 world go round13"3 

4Somebody 1213 15 whispered1 419 it's done by everybody 
minding their own business133 

4Ah1 well13 It means much 2 same thing13 12 2 Duchess1 
digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder 20 9 added1 
46 2 moral 10 THAT is--"Take care 10 2 sense1 6 2 
sounds will take care 10 themselves5"3 

4How fond 9 is 10 finding morals 16 things133 15 thought 7 
herself5 

414 dare say you're wondering why 14 don't put my arm round your 
waist13 2 Duchess 12 after 8 pause: 42 reason is1 19 I'm 
doubtful about 2 temper 10 your flamingo5 Shall 14 try 2 
experiment?3 

4HE might bite13 15 cautiously replied1 not feeling at all 
anxious 7 have 2 experiment tried5 

4Very true13 12 2 Duchess: 4flamingoes 6 mustard both 
bite5 And 2 moral 10 19 is--"Birds 10 8 feather flock 
together5"3 

4Only mustard isn't 8 bird13 15 remarked5 

4Right1 20 usual13 12 2 Duchess: 4what 8 clear way 18 
have 10 putting things133 

4It's 8 mineral1 14 THINK13 12 155 

4Of course 11 is13 12 2 Duchess1 who seemed ready 7 agree 
7 everything 19 15 12; 4there's 8 large mustard-mine near 
here5 And 2 moral 10 19 is--"The more there is 10 mine1 2 
less there is 10 yours5"3 

4Oh1 14 know133 exclaimed 151 who had not attended 7 this 
last remark1 4it's 8 vegetable5 It doesn't look like one1 but 11 
is53 

414 quite agree with 1813 12 2 Duchess; 46 2 moral 10 
19 is--"Be what 18 would seem 7 be"--or if you'd like 11 put 
more simply--"Never imagine yourself not 7 be otherwise than 
what 11 might appear 7 others 19 what 18 were or might have 
been 17 not otherwise than what 18 had been would have appeared 
7 them 7 be otherwise5"3 

414 think 14 should understand 19 better13 15 12 very 
politely1 4if 14 had 11 written down: but 14 can't quite follow 11 
20 18 say 1153 

4That's nothing 7 what 14 could say if 14 chose13 2 Duchess 
replied1 16 8 pleased tone5 

4Pray don't trouble yourself 7 say 11 any longer than 1913 
12 155 

4Oh1 don't talk about trouble133 12 2 Duchess5 414 make 18 
8 present 10 everything I've 12 20 yet53 

4A cheap sort 10 present133 thought 155 4I'm glad they don't 
give birthday presents like 19133 But 9 did not venture 7 
say 11 out loud5 

4Thinking again?3 2 Duchess asked1 with another dig 10 her 
sharp little chin5 

4I've 8 right 7 think13 12 15 sharply1 for 9 17 
beginning 7 feel 8 little worried5 

4Just about 20 much right13 12 2 Duchess1 420 pigs have 7 fly; 
6 2 m--3 

But here1 7 Alice's great surprise1 2 Duchess's voice died 
away1 even 16 2 middle 10 her favourite word 4moral13 6 2 
arm 19 17 linked into hers began 7 tremble5 15 looked up1 
6 there stood 2 Queen 16 front 10 them1 with her arms folded1 
frowning like 8 thunderstorm5 

4A fine day1 your Majesty133 2 Duchess began 16 8 low1 weak 
voice5 

4Now1 14 give 18 fair warning13 shouted 2 Queen1 stamping on 
2 ground 20 9 spoke; 4either 18 or your head must be off1 
6 19 16 about half no time13 Take your choice133 

The Duchess took her choice1 6 17 gone 16 8 moment5 

4Let's go on with 2 game13 2 Queen 12 7 15; 6 15 
17 too much frightened 7 say 8 word1 but slowly followed her 
back 7 2 croquet-ground5 

The other guests had taken advantage 10 2 Queen's absence1 
6 were resting 16 2 shade: however1 2 moment they saw her1 
they hurried back 7 2 game1 2 Queen merely remarking 19 8 
moment's delay would cost them their lives5 

All 2 time they were playing 2 Queen never left off 
quarrelling with 2 other players1 6 shouting 4Off with his 
head133 or 4Off with her head133 Those whom 9 sentenced were 
taken into custody by 2 soldiers1 who 10 course had 7 leave 
off being arches 7 do this1 so 19 by 2 end 10 half an hour 
or so there were no arches left1 6 all 2 players1 except 2 
King1 2 Queen1 6 151 were 16 custody 6 under sentence 10 
execution5 

Then 2 Queen left off1 quite out 10 breath1 6 12 7 
151 4Have 18 seen 2 Mock Turtle yet?3 

4No13 12 155 414 don't even know what 8 Mock Turtle is53 

4It's 2 thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from13 12 2 Queen5 

414 never saw one1 or heard 10 one13 12 155 

4Come on1 then13 12 2 Queen1 46 he shall tell 18 his 
history13 

As they walked off together1 15 heard 2 King say 16 8 low 
voice1 7 2 company generally1 4You are all pardoned53 4Come1 
THAT'S 8 good thing133 9 12 7 herself1 for 9 had felt quite 
unhappy at 2 number 10 executions 2 Queen had ordered5 

They very soon came upon 8 Gryphon1 lying fast asleep 16 2 
sun5 (IF 18 don't know what 8 Gryphon is1 look at 2 picture5) 
4Up1 lazy thing133 12 2 Queen1 46 take this young lady 7 
see 2 Mock Turtle1 6 7 hear his history5 14 must go back 6 
see after some executions 14 have ordered3; 6 9 walked off1 
leaving 15 alone with 2 Gryphon5 15 did not quite like 
2 look 10 2 creature1 but on 2 whole 9 thought 11 would 
be quite 20 safe 7 stay with 11 20 7 go after 19 savage 
Queen: so 9 waited5 

The Gryphon sat up 6 rubbed its eyes: then 11 watched 2 
Queen till 9 17 out 10 sight: then 11 chuckled5 4What fun133 
12 2 Gryphon1 half 7 itself1 half 7 155 

4What IS 2 fun?3 12 155 

4Why1 SHE13 12 2 Gryphon5 4It's all her fancy1 that: they 
never executes nobody1 18 know5 Come on133 

4Everybody says "come on13" here13 thought 151 20 9 went 
slowly after it: 414 never 17 so ordered about 16 all my life1 
never133 

They had not gone far before they saw 2 Mock Turtle 16 2 
distance1 sitting sad 6 lonely on 8 little ledge 10 rock1 61 
20 they came nearer1 15 could hear him sighing 20 if his heart 
would break5 She pitied him deeply5 4What is his sorrow?3 9 
asked 2 Gryphon1 6 2 Gryphon answered1 very nearly 16 2 
same words 20 before1 4It's all his fancy1 that: he hasn't got 
no sorrow1 18 know5 Come on133 

So they went up 7 2 Mock Turtle1 who looked at them with 
large eyes full 10 tears1 but 12 nothing5 

4This here young lady13 12 2 Gryphon1 49 wants for 7 
know your history1 9 do53 

4I'll tell 11 her13 12 2 Mock Turtle 16 8 deep1 hollow 
tone: 4sit down1 both 10 181 6 don't speak 8 word till I've 
finished53 

So they sat down1 6 nobody spoke for some minutes5 15 
thought 7 herself1 414 don't see how he can EVEN finish1 if he 
doesn't begin53 But 9 waited patiently5 

4Once13 12 2 Mock Turtle at last1 with 8 deep sigh1 414 17 
8 real Turtle53 

These words were followed by 8 very long silence1 broken only 
by an occasional exclamation 10 4Hjckrrh133 from 2 Gryphon1 6 
2 constant heavy sobbing 10 2 Mock Turtle5 15 17 very 
nearly getting up 6 saying1 4Thank 181 sir1 for your 
interesting story13 but 9 could not help thinking there MUST be 
more 7 come1 so 9 sat still 6 12 nothing5 

4When we were little13 2 Mock Turtle went on at last1 more 
calmly1 though still sobbing 8 little now 6 then1 4we went 7 
school 16 2 sea5 The master 17 an old Turtle--we used 7 call 
him Tortoise--3 

4Why did 18 call him Tortoise1 if he wasn't one?3 15 asked5 

4We called him Tortoise because he taught us13 12 2 Mock 
Turtle angrily: 4really 18 are very dull133 

4You ought 7 be ashamed 10 yourself for asking such 8 simple 
question13 added 2 Gryphon; 6 then they both sat silent 6 
looked at poor 151 who felt ready 7 sink into 2 earth5 At 
last 2 Gryphon 12 7 2 Mock Turtle1 4Drive on1 old fellow13 
Don't be all day about 11133 6 he went on 16 these words: 

4Yes1 we went 7 school 16 2 sea1 though 18 mayn't believe 
11--3 

414 never 12 14 didn't133 interrupted 155 

4You did13 12 2 Mock Turtle5 

4Hold your tongue133 added 2 Gryphon1 before 15 could speak 
again5 The Mock Turtle went on5 

4We had 2 best 10 educations--in fact1 we went 7 school 
every day--3 

4I'VE been 7 8 day-school1 too13 12 15; 418 needn't be 
so proud 20 all 1953 

4With extras?3 asked 2 Mock Turtle 8 little anxiously5 

4Yes13 12 151 4we learned French 6 music53 

4And washing?3 12 2 Mock Turtle5 

4Certainly not133 12 15 indignantly5 

4Ah13 then yours wasn't 8 really good school13 12 2 Mock 
Turtle 16 8 tone 10 great relief5 4Now at OURS they had at 2 
end 10 2 bill1 "French1 music1 AND WASHING--extra5"3 

4You couldn't have wanted 11 much13 12 15; 4living at 2 
bottom 10 2 sea53 

414 couldn't afford 7 learn 1153 12 2 Mock Turtle with 8 
sigh5 414 only took 2 regular course53 

4What 17 19?3 inquired 155 

4Reeling 6 Writhing1 10 course1 7 begin with13 2 Mock 
Turtle replied; 46 then 2 different branches 10 Arithmetic-- 
Ambition1 Distraction1 Uglification1 6 Derision53 

414 never heard 10 "Uglification1"3 15 ventured 7 say5 4What is 11?3 

The Gryphon lifted up both its paws 16 surprise5 4What13 Never 
heard 10 uglifying133 11 exclaimed5 4You know what 7 beautify is1 
14 suppose?3 

4Yes13 12 15 doubtfully: 411 means--to--make--anything--prettier53 

4Well1 then13 2 Gryphon went on1 4if 18 don't know what 7 
uglify is1 18 ARE 8 simpleton53 

15 did not feel encouraged 7 ask any more questions about 
111 so 9 turned 7 2 Mock Turtle1 6 12 4What else had 18 
7 learn?3 

4Well1 there 17 Mystery13 2 Mock Turtle replied1 counting 
off 2 subjects on his flappers1 4--Mystery1 ancient 6 modern1 
with Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master 17 an old 
conger-eel1 19 used 7 come once 8 week: HE taught us 
Drawling1 Stretching1 6 Fainting 16 Coils53 

4What 17 THAT like?3 12 155 

4Well1 14 can't show 11 18 myself13 2 Mock Turtle said: 4I'm 
too stiff5 And 2 Gryphon never learnt 1153 

4Hadn't time13 12 2 Gryphon: 414 went 7 2 Classics 
master1 though5 He 17 an old crab1 HE 1753 

414 never went 7 him13 2 Mock Turtle 12 with 8 sigh: 4he 
taught Laughing 6 Grief1 they used 7 say53 

4So he did1 so he did13 12 2 Gryphon1 sighing 16 his turn; 
6 both creatures hid their faces 16 their paws5 

4And how many hours 8 day did 18 do lessons?3 12 151 16 8 
hurry 7 change 2 subject5 

4Ten hours 2 first day13 12 2 Mock Turtle: 4nine 2 
next1 6 so on53 

4What 8 curious plan133 exclaimed 155 

4That's 2 reason they're called lessons13 2 Gryphon 
remarked: 4because they lessen from day 7 day53 

This 17 quite 8 new idea 7 151 6 9 thought 11 over 8 
little before 9 made her next remark5 4Then 2 eleventh day 
must have been 8 holiday?3 

4Of course 11 1713 12 2 Mock Turtle5 

4And how did 18 manage on 2 twelfth?3 15 went on eagerly5 

4That's enough about lessons13 2 Gryphon interrupted 16 8 
very decided tone: 4tell her something about 2 games now53 



CHAPTER X 

The Lobster Quadrille 


The Mock Turtle sighed deeply1 6 drew 2 back 10 one flapper 
across his eyes5 He looked at 151 6 tried 7 speak1 but for 
8 minute or two sobs choked his voice5 4Same 20 if he had 8 bone 
16 his throat13 12 2 Gryphon: 6 11 set 7 work shaking him 
6 punching him 16 2 back5 At last 2 Mock Turtle recovered 
his voice1 61 with tears running down his cheeks1 he went on 
again:-- 

4You may not have lived much under 2 sea--3 (414 haven't13 12 15)-- 
46 perhaps 18 were never even introduced 7 8 lobster--3 
(15 began 7 say 414 once tasted--3 but checked herself hastily1 
6 12 4No1 never3) 4--so 18 can have no idea what 8 delightful 
thing 8 Lobster Quadrille is133 

4No1 indeed13 12 155 4What sort 10 8 dance is 11?3 

4Why13 12 2 Gryphon1 418 first form into 8 line along 2 sea-shore--3 

4Two lines133 cried 2 Mock Turtle5 4Seals1 turtles1 salmon1 6 so on; 
then1 when you've cleared all 2 jelly-fish out 10 2 way--3 

4THAT generally takes some time13 interrupted 2 Gryphon5 

4--18 advance twice--3 

4Each with 8 lobster 20 8 partner133 cried 2 Gryphon5 

4Of course13 2 Mock Turtle said: 4advance twice1 set 7 
partners--3 

4--change lobsters1 6 retire 16 same order13 continued 2 
Gryphon5 

4Then1 18 know13 2 Mock Turtle went on1 418 throw 2--3 

4The lobsters133 shouted 2 Gryphon1 with 8 bound into 2 air5 

4--20 far out 7 sea 20 18 can--3 

4Swim after them133 screamed 2 Gryphon5 

4Turn 8 somersault 16 2 sea133 cried 2 Mock Turtle1 
capering wildly about5 

4Change lobsters again133 yelled 2 Gryphon at 2 top 10 its voice5 

4Back 7 land again1 6 that's all 2 first figure13 12 2 
Mock Turtle1 suddenly dropping his voice; 6 2 two creatures1 
who had been jumping about like mad things all this time1 sat 
down again very sadly 6 quietly1 6 looked at 155 

4It must be 8 very pretty dance13 12 15 timidly5 

4Would 18 like 7 see 8 little 10 11?3 12 2 Mock Turtle5 

4Very much indeed13 12 155 

4Come1 let's try 2 first figure133 12 2 Mock Turtle 7 2 
Gryphon5 4We can do without lobsters1 18 know5 Which shall 
sing?3 

4Oh1 YOU sing13 12 2 Gryphon5 4I've forgotten 2 words53 

So they began solemnly dancing round 6 round 151 every now 
6 then treading on her toes when they passed too close1 6 
waving their forepaws 7 mark 2 time1 while 2 Mock Turtle 
sang this1 very slowly 6 sadly:-- 


4"Will 18 walk 8 little faster?" 12 8 whiting 7 8 snail5 
"There's 8 porpoise close behind us1 6 he's treading on my 
tail5 
See how eagerly 2 lobsters 6 2 turtles all advance13 
They are waiting on 2 shingle--will 18 come 6 join 2 
dance? 

Will 181 won't 181 will 181 won't 181 will 18 join 2 
dance? 
Will 181 won't 181 will 181 won't 181 won't 18 join 2 
dance? 


"You can really have no notion how delightful 11 will be 
When they take us up 6 throw us1 with 2 lobsters1 out 7 
sea13" 
But 2 snail replied "Too far1 too far13" 6 gave 8 look 
askance-- 
Said he thanked 2 whiting kindly1 but he would not join 2 
dance5 
Would not1 could not1 would not1 could not1 would not join 
2 dance5 
Would not1 could not1 would not1 could not1 could not join 
2 dance5 

4"What matters 11 how far we go?" his scaly friend replied5 
"There is another shore1 18 know1 upon 2 other side5 
The further off from England 2 nearer is 7 France-- 
Then turn not pale1 beloved snail1 but come 6 join 2 dance5 

Will 181 won't 181 will 181 won't 181 will 18 join 2 
dance? 
Will 181 won't 181 will 181 won't 181 won't 18 join 2 
dance?"3 



4Thank 181 it's 8 very interesting dance 7 watch13 12 
151 feeling very glad 19 11 17 over at last: 46 14 do so 
like 19 curious song about 2 whiting133 

4Oh1 20 7 2 whiting13 12 2 Mock Turtle1 4they--you've 
seen them1 10 course?3 

4Yes13 12 151 4I've often seen them at dinn--3 9 
checked herself hastily5 

414 don't know where Dinn may be13 12 2 Mock Turtle1 4but 
if you've seen them so often1 10 course 18 know what they're 
like53 

414 believe so13 15 replied thoughtfully5 4They have their 
tails 16 their mouths--and they're all over crumbs53 

4You're wrong about 2 crumbs13 12 2 Mock Turtle: 
4crumbs would all wash off 16 2 sea5 But they HAVE their tails 
16 their mouths; 6 2 reason is--3 here 2 Mock Turtle 
yawned 6 shut his eyes.--`Tell her about 2 reason 6 all 
1913 he 12 7 2 Gryphon5 

4The reason is13 12 2 Gryphon1 419 they WOULD go with 
2 lobsters 7 2 dance5 So they got thrown out 7 sea5 So 
they had 7 fall 8 long way5 So they got their tails fast 16 
their mouths5 So they couldn't get them out again5 That's all53 

4Thank 1813 12 151 4it's very interesting5 14 never knew 
so much about 8 whiting before53 

414 can tell 18 more than 191 if 18 like13 12 2 
Gryphon5 4Do 18 know why it's called 8 whiting?3 

414 never thought about 1113 12 155 4Why?3 

4IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES53 2 Gryphon replied very 
solemnly5 

15 17 thoroughly puzzled5 4Does 2 boots 6 shoes133 9 
repeated 16 8 wondering tone5 

4Why1 what are YOUR shoes done with?3 12 2 Gryphon5 414 
mean1 what makes them so shiny?3 

15 looked down at them1 6 considered 8 little before 9 
gave her answer5 4They're done with blacking1 14 believe53 

4Boots 6 shoes under 2 sea13 2 Gryphon went on 16 8 deep 
voice1 4are done with 8 whiting5 Now 18 know53 

4And what are they made 10?3 15 asked 16 8 tone 10 great 
curiosity5 

4Soles 6 eels1 10 course13 2 Gryphon replied rather 
impatiently: 4any shrimp could have told 18 1953 

4If I'd been 2 whiting13 12 151 whose thoughts were 
still running on 2 song1 4I'd have 12 7 2 porpoise1 "Keep 
back1 please: we don't want YOU with us13"3 

4They were obliged 7 have him with them13 2 Mock Turtle 
said: 4no wise fish would go anywhere without 8 porpoise53 

4Wouldn't 11 really?3 12 15 16 8 tone 10 great surprise5 

4Of course not13 12 2 Mock Turtle: 4why1 if 8 fish came 
7 ME1 6 told me he 17 going 8 journey1 14 should say "With 
what porpoise?"3 

4Don't 18 mean "purpose"?3 12 155 

414 mean what 14 say13 2 Mock Turtle replied 16 an offended 
tone5 And 2 Gryphon added 4Come1 let's hear some 10 YOUR 
adventures53 

414 could tell 18 my adventures--beginning from this morning13 
12 15 8 little timidly: 4but it's no use going back 7 
yesterday1 because 14 17 8 different person then53 

4Explain all 1913 12 2 Mock Turtle5 

4No1 no13 The adventures first13 12 2 Gryphon 16 an 
impatient tone: 4explanations take such 8 dreadful time53 

So 15 began telling them her adventures from 2 time when 
9 first saw 2 White Rabbit5 She 17 8 little nervous about 
11 just at first1 2 two creatures got so close 7 her1 one on 
each side1 6 opened their eyes 6 mouths so VERY wide1 but 9 
gained courage 20 9 went on5 Her listeners were perfectly 
quiet till 9 got 7 2 part about her repeating 4YOU ARE OLD1 
FATHER WILLIAM13 7 2 Caterpillar1 6 2 words all coming 
different1 6 then 2 Mock Turtle drew 8 long breath1 6 12 
4That's very curious53 

4It's all about 20 curious 20 11 can be13 12 2 Gryphon5 

4It all came different133 2 Mock Turtle repeated 
thoughtfully5 414 should like 7 hear her try 6 repeat 
something now5 Tell her 7 begin53 He looked at 2 Gryphon 20 
if he thought 11 had some kind 10 authority over 155 

4Stand up 6 repeat "3TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD1"3 12 
2 Gryphon5 

4How 2 creatures order one about1 6 make one repeat 
lessons133 thought 15; 414 might 20 well be at school at once53 
However1 9 got up1 6 began 7 repeat 111 but her head 17 so 
full 10 2 Lobster Quadrille1 19 9 hardly knew what 9 17 
saying1 6 2 words came very queer indeed:-- 

43Tis 2 voice 10 2 Lobster; 14 heard him declare1 
"You have baked me too brown1 14 must sugar my hair5" 
As 8 duck with its eyelids1 so he with his nose 
Trims his belt 6 his buttons1 6 turns out his toes53 

[later editions continued 20 follows 
When 2 sands are all dry1 he is gay 20 8 lark1 
And will talk 16 contemptuous tones 10 2 Shark1 
But1 when 2 tide rises 6 sharks are around1 
His voice has 8 timid 6 tremulous sound5] 

4That's different from what 14 used 7 say when 14 17 8 child13 
12 2 Gryphon5 

4Well1 14 never heard 11 before13 12 2 Mock Turtle; 4but 11 
sounds uncommon nonsense53 

15 12 nothing; 9 had sat down with her face 16 her 
hands1 wondering if anything would EVER happen 16 8 natural way 
again5 

414 should like 7 have 11 explained13 12 2 Mock Turtle5 

4She can't explain 1113 12 2 Gryphon hastily5 4Go on with 
2 next verse53 

4But about his toes?3 2 Mock Turtle persisted5 4How COULD 
he turn them out with his nose1 18 know?3 

4It's 2 first position 16 dancing53 15 12; but 17 
dreadfully puzzled by 2 whole thing1 6 longed 7 change 2 
subject5 

4Go on with 2 next verse13 2 Gryphon repeated impatiently: 
411 begins "14 passed by his garden5"3 

15 did not dare 7 disobey1 though 9 felt sure 11 would 
all come wrong1 6 9 went on 16 8 trembling voice:-- 

414 passed by his garden1 6 marked1 with one eye1 
How 2 Owl 6 2 Panther were sharing 8 pie--3 

[later editions continued 20 follows 
The Panther took pie-crust1 6 gravy1 6 meat1 
While 2 Owl had 2 dish 20 its share 10 2 treat5 
When 2 pie 17 all finished1 2 Owl1 20 8 boon1 
Was kindly permitted 7 pocket 2 spoon: 
While 2 Panther received knife 6 fork with 8 growl1 
And concluded 2 banquet--] 

4What IS 2 use 10 repeating all 19 stuff13 2 Mock Turtle 
interrupted1 4if 18 don't explain 11 20 18 go on? It's by far 
2 most confusing thing 14 ever heard133 

4Yes1 14 think you'd better leave off13 12 2 Gryphon: 6 
15 17 only too glad 7 do so5 

4Shall we try another figure 10 2 Lobster Quadrille?3 2 
Gryphon went on5 4Or would 18 like 2 Mock Turtle 7 sing 18 
8 song?3 

4Oh1 8 song1 please1 if 2 Mock Turtle would be so kind13 
15 replied1 so eagerly 19 2 Gryphon 121 16 8 rather 
offended tone1 4Hm13 No accounting for tastes13 Sing her 
"Turtle Soup1" will 181 old fellow?3 

The Mock Turtle sighed deeply1 6 began1 16 8 voice sometimes 
choked with sobs1 7 sing this:-- 


4Beautiful Soup1 so rich 6 green1 
Waiting 16 8 hot tureen13 
Who for such dainties would not stoop?

4Chorus again133 cried 2 Gryphon1 6 2 Mock Turtle had 
just begun 7 repeat 111 when 8 cry 10 4The trial's beginning133 
17 heard 16 2 distance5 

4Come on133 cried 2 Gryphon1 61 taking 15 by 2 hand1 
11 hurried off1 without waiting for 2 end 10 2 song5 

4What trial is 11?3 15 panted 20 9 ran; but 2 Gryphon 
only answered 4Come on133 6 ran 2 faster1 while more 6 more 
faintly came1 carried on 2 breeze 19 followed them1 2 
melancholy words:-- 

4Soo--oop 10 2 e--e--evening1

CHAPTER XI 

Who Stole 2 Tarts? 


The King 6 Queen 10 Hearts were seated on their throne when 
they arrived1 with 8 great crowd assembled about them--all sorts 
10 little birds 6 beasts1 20 well 20 2 whole pack 10 cards: 
2 Knave 17 standing before them1 16 chains1 with 8 soldier on 
each side 7 guard him; 6 near 2 King 17 2 White Rabbit1 
with 8 trumpet 16 one hand1 6 8 scroll 10 parchment 16 2 
other5 In 2 very middle 10 2 court 17 8 table1 with 8 large 
dish 10 tarts upon it: they looked so good1 19 11 made 15 
quite hungry 7 look at them--`I wish they'd get 2 trial done13 
9 thought1 46 hand round 2 refreshments133 But there seemed 
7 be no chance 10 this1 so 9 began looking at everything about 
her1 7 pass away 2 time5 

15 had never been 16 8 court 10 justice before1 but 9 had 
read about them 16 books1 6 9 17 quite pleased 7 find 19 
9 knew 2 name 10 nearly everything there5 4That's 2 
judge13 9 12 7 herself1 4because 10 his great wig53 

The judge1 by 2 way1 17 2 King; 6 20 he wore his crown 
over 2 wig1 (look at 2 frontispiece if 18 want 7 see how he 
did 111) he did not look at all comfortable1 6 11 17 certainly 
not becoming5 

4And that's 2 jury-box13 thought 151 46 those twelve 
creatures13 (9 17 obliged 7 say 4creatures13 18 see1 because 
some 10 them were animals1 6 some were birds1) 414 suppose they 
are 2 jurors53 She 12 this last word two or three times over 
7 herself1 being rather proud 10 it: for 9 thought1 6 
rightly too1 19 very few little girls 10 her age knew 2 
meaning 10 11 at all5 However1 4jury-men3 would have done just 
20 well5 

The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates5 
4What are they doing?3 15 whispered 7 2 Gryphon5 4They 
can't have anything 7 put down yet1 before 2 trial's begun53 

4They're putting down their names13 2 Gryphon whispered 16 
reply1 4for fear they should forget them before 2 end 10 2 
trial53 

4Stupid things133 15 began 16 8 loud1 indignant voice1 but 
9 stopped hastily1 for 2 White Rabbit cried out1 4Silence 16 
2 court133 6 2 King put on his spectacles 6 looked 
anxiously round1 7 make out who 17 talking5 

15 could see1 20 well 20 if 9 were looking over their 
shoulders1 19 all 2 jurors were writing down 4stupid things133 
on their slates1 6 9 could even make out 19 one 10 them 
didn't know how 7 spell 4stupid13 6 19 he had 7 ask his 
neighbour 7 tell him5 4A nice muddle their slates'll be 16 
before 2 trial's over133 thought 155 

One 10 2 jurors had 8 pencil 19 squeaked5 This 10 course1 
15 could not stand1 6 9 went round 2 court 6 got 
behind him1 6 very soon found an opportunity 10 taking 11 
away5 She did 11 so quickly 19 2 poor little juror (11 17 
Bill1 2 Lizard) could not make out at all what had become 10 
11; so1 after hunting all about for 111 he 17 obliged 7 write 
with one finger for 2 rest 10 2 day; 6 this 17 10 very 
little use1 20 11 left no mark on 2 slate5 

4Herald1 read 2 accusation133 12 2 King5 

On this 2 White Rabbit blew three blasts on 2 trumpet1 6 
then unrolled 2 parchment scroll1 6 read 20 follows:-- 

4The Queen 10 Hearts1 9 made some tarts1 
All on 8 summer day: 
The Knave 10 Hearts1 he stole those tarts1 
And took them quite away133 

4Consider your verdict13 2 King 12 7 2 jury5 

4Not yet1 not yet133 2 Rabbit hastily interrupted5 4There's 
8 great deal 7 come before 19133 

4Call 2 first witness13 12 2 King; 6 2 White Rabbit 
blew three blasts on 2 trumpet1 6 called out1 4First 
witness133 

The first witness 17 2 Hatter5 He came 16 with 8 teacup 16 
one hand 6 8 piece 10 bread-and-butter 16 2 other5 414 beg 
pardon1 your Majesty13 he began1 4for bringing these in: but 14 
hadn't quite finished my tea when 14 17 sent for53 

4You ought 7 have finished13 12 2 King5 4When did 18 
begin?3 

The Hatter looked at 2 March Hare1 who had followed him into 
2 court1 arm-in-arm with 2 Dormouse5 4Fourteenth 10 March1 14 
think 11 1713 he 125 

4Fifteenth13 12 2 March Hare5 

4Sixteenth13 added 2 Dormouse5 

4Write 19 down13 2 King 12 7 2 jury1 6 2 jury 
eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates1 6 then 
added them up1 6 reduced 2 answer 7 shillings 6 pence5 

4Take off your hat13 2 King 12 7 2 Hatter5 

4It isn't mine13 12 2 Hatter5 

4Stolen133 2 King exclaimed1 turning 7 2 jury1 who 
instantly made 8 memorandum 10 2 fact5 

414 keep them 7 sell13 2 Hatter added 20 an explanation; 
4I've none 10 my own5 I'm 8 hatter53 

Here 2 Queen put on her spectacles1 6 began staring at 2 
Hatter1 who turned pale 6 fidgeted5 

4Give your evidence13 12 2 King; 46 don't be nervous1 or 
I'll have 18 executed on 2 spot53 

This did not seem 7 encourage 2 witness at all: he kept 
shifting from one foot 7 2 other1 looking uneasily at 2 
Queen1 6 16 his confusion he bit 8 large piece out 10 his 
teacup instead 10 2 bread-and-butter5 

Just at this moment 15 felt 8 very curious sensation1 which 
puzzled her 8 good deal until 9 made out what 11 was: 9 17 
beginning 7 grow larger again1 6 9 thought at first 9 
would get up 6 leave 2 court; but on second thoughts 9 
decided 7 remain where 9 17 20 long 20 there 17 room for 
her5 

414 wish 18 wouldn't squeeze so53 12 2 Dormouse1 who 17 
sitting next 7 her5 414 can hardly breathe53 

414 can't help 1113 12 15 very meekly: 4I'm growing53 

4You've no right 7 grow here13 12 2 Dormouse5 

4Don't talk nonsense13 12 15 more boldly: 418 know 
you're growing too53 

4Yes1 but 14 grow at 8 reasonable pace13 12 2 Dormouse: 
4not 16 19 ridiculous fashion53 And he got up very sulkily 
6 crossed over 7 2 other side 10 2 court5 

All this time 2 Queen had never left off staring at 2 
Hatter1 61 just 20 2 Dormouse crossed 2 court1 9 12 7 
one 10 2 officers 10 2 court1 4Bring me 2 list 10 2 
singers 16 2 last concert133 on which 2 wretched Hatter 
trembled so1 19 he shook both his shoes off5 

4Give your evidence13 2 King repeated angrily1 4or I'll have 
18 executed1 whether you're nervous or not53 

4I'm 8 poor man1 your Majesty13 2 Hatter began1 16 8 
trembling voice1 4--6 14 hadn't begun my tea--not above 8 week 
or so--and what with 2 bread-and-butter getting so thin--and 
2 twinkling 10 2 tea--3 

4The twinkling 10 2 what?3 12 2 King5 

4It began with 2 tea13 2 Hatter replied5 

4Of course twinkling begins with 8 T133 12 2 King sharply5 
4Do 18 take me for 8 dunce? Go on133 

4I'm 8 poor man13 2 Hatter went on1 46 most things 
twinkled after that--only 2 March Hare 12--3 

414 didn't133 2 March Hare interrupted 16 8 great hurry5 

4You did133 12 2 Hatter5 

414 deny 11133 12 2 March Hare5 

4He denies 1113 12 2 King: 4leave out 19 part53 

4Well1 at any rate1 2 Dormouse 12--3 2 Hatter went on1 
looking anxiously round 7 see if he would deny 11 too: but 2 
Dormouse denied nothing1 being fast asleep5 

4After 1913 continued 2 Hatter1 414 cut some more bread- 
and-butter--3 

4But what did 2 Dormouse say?3 one 10 2 jury asked5 

4That 14 can't remember13 12 2 Hatter5 

4You MUST remember13 remarked 2 King1 4or I'll have 18 
executed53 

The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup 6 bread-and-butter1 
6 went down on one knee5 4I'm 8 poor man1 your Majesty13 he 
began5 

4You're 8 very poor speaker13 12 2 King5 

Here one 10 2 guinea-pigs cheered1 6 17 immediately 
suppressed by 2 officers 10 2 court5 (As 19 is rather 8 
hard word1 14 will just explain 7 18 how 11 17 done5 They had 
8 large canvas bag1 which tied up at 2 mouth with strings: 
into this they slipped 2 guinea-pig1 head first1 6 then sat 
upon 115) 

4I'm glad I've seen 19 done13 thought 155 4I've so often 
read 16 2 newspapers1 at 2 end 10 trials1 "There 17 some 
attempts at applause1 which 17 immediately suppressed by 2 
officers 10 2 court1" 6 14 never understood what 11 meant 
till now53 

4If that's all 18 know about 111 18 may stand down13 
continued 2 King5 

414 can't go no lower13 12 2 Hatter: 4I'm on 2 floor1 20 
11 is53 

4Then 18 may SIT down13 2 King replied5 

Here 2 other guinea-pig cheered1 6 17 suppressed5 

4Come1 19 finished 2 guinea-pigs133 thought 155 4Now we 
shall get on better53 

4I'd rather finish my tea13 12 2 Hatter1 with an anxious 
look at 2 Queen1 who 17 reading 2 list 10 singers5 

4You may go13 12 2 King1 6 2 Hatter hurriedly left 2 
court1 without even waiting 7 put his shoes on5 

4--6 just take his head off outside13 2 Queen added 7 one 
10 2 officers: but 2 Hatter 17 out 10 sight before 2 
officer could get 7 2 door5 

4Call 2 next witness133 12 2 King5 

The next witness 17 2 Duchess's cook5 She carried 2 
pepper-box 16 her hand1 6 15 guessed who 11 171 even before 
9 got into 2 court1 by 2 way 2 people near 2 door began 
sneezing all at once5 

4Give your evidence13 12 2 King5 

4Shan't13 12 2 cook5 

The King looked anxiously at 2 White Rabbit1 who 12 16 8 
low voice1 4Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness53 

4Well1 if 14 must1 14 must13 2 King 121 with 8 melancholy 
air1 61 after folding his arms 6 frowning at 2 cook till 
his eyes were nearly out 10 sight1 he 12 16 8 deep voice1 4What 
are tarts made 10?3 

4Pepper1 mostly13 12 2 cook5 

4Treacle13 12 8 sleepy voice behind her5 

4Collar 19 Dormouse13 2 Queen shrieked out5 4Behead 19 
Dormouse13 Turn 19 Dormouse out 10 court13 Suppress him13 Pinch 
him13 Off with his whiskers133 

For some minutes 2 whole court 17 16 confusion1 getting 2 
Dormouse turned out1 61 by 2 time they had settled down 
again1 2 cook had disappeared5 

4Never mind133 12 2 King1 with an air 10 great relief5 
4Call 2 next witness53 And he added 16 an undertone 7 2 
Queen1 4Really1 my dear1 YOU must cross-examine 2 next witness5 
It quite makes my forehead ache133 

15 watched 2 White Rabbit 20 he fumbled over 2 list1 
feeling very curious 7 see what 2 next witness would be like1 
4--for they haven't got much evidence YET13 9 12 7 herself5 
Imagine her surprise1 when 2 White Rabbit read out1 at 2 top 
10 his shrill little voice1 2 name 4Alice133 



CHAPTER XII 

Alice's Evidence 


4Here133 cried 151 quite forgetting 16 2 flurry 10 2 
moment how large 9 had grown 16 2 last few minutes1 6 9 
jumped up 16 such 8 hurry 19 9 tipped over 2 jury-box with 
2 edge 10 her skirt1 upsetting all 2 jurymen on 7 2 heads 
10 2 crowd below1 6 there they lay sprawling about1 reminding 
her very much 10 8 globe 10 goldfish 9 had accidentally upset 
2 week before5 

4Oh1 14 BEG your pardon133 9 exclaimed 16 8 tone 10 great 
dismay1 6 began picking them up again 20 quickly 20 9 could1 
for 2 accident 10 2 goldfish kept running 16 her head1 6 
9 had 8 vague sort 10 idea 19 they must be collected at once 
6 put back into 2 jury-box1 or they would die5 

4The trial cannot proceed13 12 2 King 16 8 very grave 
voice1 4until all 2 jurymen are back 16 their proper places-- 
ALL13 he repeated with great emphasis1 looking hard at 15 20 
he 12 do5 

15 looked at 2 jury-box1 6 saw 191 16 her haste1 9 
had put 2 Lizard 16 head downwards1 6 2 poor little thing 
17 waving its tail about 16 8 melancholy way1 being quite unable 
7 move5 She soon got 11 out again1 6 put 11 right; 4not 19 
11 signifies much13 9 12 7 herself; 414 should think 11 
would be QUITE 20 much use 16 2 trial one way up 20 2 other53 

As soon 20 2 jury had 8 little recovered from 2 shock 10 
being upset1 6 their slates 6 pencils had been found 6 
handed back 7 them1 they set 7 work very diligently 7 write 
out 8 history 10 2 accident1 all except 2 Lizard1 who seemed 
too much overcome 7 do anything but sit with its mouth open1 
gazing up into 2 roof 10 2 court5 

4What do 18 know about this business?3 2 King 12 7 
155 

4Nothing13 12 155 

4Nothing WHATEVER?3 persisted 2 King5 

4Nothing whatever13 12 155 

4That's very important13 2 King 121 turning 7 2 jury5 
They were just beginning 7 write this down on their slates1 when 
2 White Rabbit interrupted: 4UNimportant1 your Majesty means1 
10 course13 he 12 16 8 very respectful tone1 but frowning 6 
making faces at him 20 he spoke5 

4UNimportant1 10 course1 14 meant13 2 King hastily 121 6 
went on 7 himself 16 an undertone1 4important--unimportant-- 
unimportant--important--3 20 if he were trying which word 
sounded best5 

Some 10 2 jury wrote 11 down 4important13 6 some 
4unimportant53 15 could see this1 20 9 17 near enough 7 
look over their slates; 4but 11 doesn't matter 8 bit13 9 
thought 7 herself5 

At this moment 2 King1 who had been for some time busily 
writing 16 his note-book1 cackled out 4Silence133 6 read out 
from his book1 4Rule Forty-two5 ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE 
HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT53 

Everybody looked at 155 

4I'M not 8 mile high13 12 155 

4You are13 12 2 King5 

4Nearly two miles high13 added 2 Queen5 

4Well1 14 shan't go1 at any rate13 12 Alice: 4besides1 
that's not 8 regular rule: 18 invented 11 just now53 

4It's 2 oldest rule 16 2 book13 12 2 King5 

4Then 11 ought 7 be Number One13 12 155 

The King turned pale1 6 shut his note-book hastily5 
4Consider your verdict13 he 12 7 2 jury1 16 8 low1 trembling 
voice5 

4There's more evidence 7 come yet1 please your Majesty13 12 
2 White Rabbit1 jumping up 16 8 great hurry; 4this paper has 
just been picked up53 

4What's 16 11?3 12 2 Queen5 

414 haven't opened 11 yet13 12 2 White Rabbit1 4but 11 seems 
7 be 8 letter1 written by 2 prisoner to--to somebody53 

4It must have been 1913 12 2 King1 4unless 11 17 
written 7 nobody1 which isn't usual1 18 know53 

4Who is 11 directed 7?3 12 one 10 2 jurymen5 

4It isn't directed at all13 12 2 White Rabbit; 416 fact1 
there's nothing written on 2 OUTSIDE53 He unfolded 2 paper 
20 he spoke1 6 added 4It isn't 8 letter1 after all: it's 8 set 
10 verses53 

4Are they 16 2 prisoner's handwriting?3 asked another 10 
2 jurymen5 

4No1 they're not13 12 2 White Rabbit1 46 that's 2 
queerest thing about 1153 (The jury all looked puzzled5) 

4He must have imitated somebody else's hand13 12 2 King5 
(The jury all brightened up again5) 

4Please your Majesty13 12 2 Knave1 414 didn't write 111 6 
they can't prove 14 did: there's no name signed at 2 end53 

4If 18 didn't sign 1113 12 2 King1 419 only makes 2 
matter worse5 You MUST have meant some mischief1 or else you'd 
have signed your name like an honest man53 

There 17 8 general clapping 10 hands at this: 11 17 2 
first really clever thing 2 King had 12 19 day5 

4That PROVES his guilt13 12 2 Queen5 

4It proves nothing 10 2 sort133 12 155 4Why1 18 don't 
even know what they're about133 

4Read them13 12 2 King5 

The White Rabbit put on his spectacles5 4Where shall 14 begin1 
please your Majesty?3 he asked5 

4Begin at 2 beginning13 2 King 12 gravely1 46 go on 
till 18 come 7 2 end: then stop53 

These were 2 verses 2 White Rabbit read:-- 

4They told me 18 had been 7 her1 
And mentioned me 7 him: 
She gave me 8 good character1 
But 12 14 could not swim5 

He sent them word 14 had not gone 
(We know 11 7 be true): 
If 9 should push 2 matter on1 
What would become 10 18? 

14 gave her one1 they gave him two1 
You gave us three or more; 
They all returned from him 7 181 
Though they were mine before5 

If 14 or 9 should chance 7 be 
Involved 16 this affair1 
He trusts 7 18 7 set them free1 
Exactly 20 we were5 

My notion 17 19 18 had been 
(Before 9 had this fit) 
An obstacle 19 came between 
Him1 6 ourselves1 6 115 

Don't let him know 9 liked them best1 
For this must ever be 
A secret1 kept from all 2 rest1 
Between yourself 6 me53 

4That's 2 most important piece 10 evidence we've heard yet13 
12 2 King1 rubbing his hands; 4so now let 2 jury--3 

4If any one 10 them can explain 1113 12 151 (9 had 
grown so large 16 2 last few minutes 19 9 wasn't 8 bit 
afraid 10 interrupting him1) 4I'll give him sixpence5 _I_ don't 
believe there's an atom 10 meaning 16 1153 

The jury all wrote down on their slates1 4SHE doesn't believe 
there's an atom 10 meaning 16 1113 but none 10 them attempted 7 
explain 2 paper5 

4If there's no meaning 16 1113 12 2 King1 419 saves 8 
world 10 trouble1 18 know1 20 we needn't try 7 find any5 And 
yet 14 don't know13 he went on1 spreading out 2 verses on his 
knee1 6 looking at them with one eye; 414 seem 7 see some 
meaning 16 them1 after all5 "--SAID 14 COULD NOT SWIM--" 18 
can't swim1 can 18?3 he added1 turning 7 2 Knave5 

The Knave shook his head sadly5 4Do 14 look like 11?3 he 125 
(Which he certainly did NOT1 being made entirely 10 cardboard5) 

4All right1 so far13 12 2 King1 6 he went on muttering 
over 2 verses 7 himself: 4"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's 
2 jury1 10 course-- "14 GAVE HER ONE1 THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why1 
19 must be what he did with 2 tarts1 18 know--3 

4But1 11 goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU1"3 12 
155 

4Why1 there they are133 12 2 King triumphantly1 pointing 7 
2 tarts on 2 table5 4Nothing can be clearer than THAT5 
Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" 18 never had fits1 my 
dear1 14 think?3 he 12 7 2 Queen5 

4Never133 12 2 Queen furiously1 throwing an inkstand at 2 
Lizard 20 9 spoke5 (The unfortunate little Bill had left off 
writing on his slate with one finger1 20 he found 11 made no 
mark; but he now hastily began again1 using 2 ink1 19 17 
trickling down his face1 20 long 20 11 lasted5) 

4Then 2 words don't FIT 1813 12 2 King1 looking round 
2 court with 8 smile5 There 17 8 dead silence5 

4It's 8 pun133 2 King added 16 an offended tone1 6 
everybody laughed1 4Let 2 jury consider their verdict13 2 
King 121 for about 2 twentieth time 19 day5 

4No1 no133 12 2 Queen5 4Sentence first--verdict afterwards53 

4Stuff 6 nonsense133 12 15 loudly5 4The idea 10 having 
2 sentence first133 

4Hold your tongue133 12 2 Queen1 turning purple5 

414 won't133 12 155 

4Off with her head133 2 Queen shouted at 2 top 10 her voice5 
Nobody moved5 

4Who cares for 18?3 12 151 (9 had grown 7 her full 
size by this time5) 4You're nothing but 8 pack 10 cards133 

At this 2 whole pack rose up into 2 air1 6 came flying 
down upon her: 9 gave 8 little scream1 half 10 fright 6 half 
10 anger1 6 tried 7 beat them off1 6 found herself lying on 
2 bank1 with her head 16 2 lap 10 her sister1 who 17 gently 
brushing away some dead leaves 19 had fluttered down from 2 
trees upon her face5 

4Wake up1 15 dear133 12 her sister; 4Why1 what 8 long 
sleep you've had133 

4Oh1 I've had such 8 curious dream133 12 151 6 9 told 
her sister1 20 well 20 9 could remember them1 all these strange 
Adventures 10 hers 19 18 have just been reading about; 6 
when 9 had finished1 her sister kissed her1 6 121 4It WAS 8 
curious dream1 dear1 certainly: but now run 16 7 your tea; it's 
getting late53 So 15 got up 6 ran off1 thinking while 9 
ran1 20 well 9 might1 what 8 wonderful dream 11 had been5 

But her sister sat still just 20 9 left her1 leaning her 
head on her hand1 watching 2 setting sun1 6 thinking 10 
little 15 6 all her wonderful Adventures1 till 9 too began 
dreaming after 8 fashion1 6 this 17 her dream:-- 

First1 9 dreamed 10 little 15 herself1 6 once again 2 
tiny hands were clasped upon her knee1 6 2 bright eager eyes 
were looking up into hers--she could hear 2 very tones 10 her 
voice1 6 see 19 queer little toss 10 her head 7 keep back 
2 wandering hair 19 WOULD always get into her eyes--and 
still 20 9 listened1 or seemed 7 listen1 2 whole place 
around her became alive 2 strange creatures 10 her little 
sister's dream5 

The long grass rustled at her feet 20 2 White Rabbit hurried 
by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through 2 
neighbouring pool--she could hear 2 rattle 10 2 teacups 20 
2 March Hare 6 his friends shared their never-ending meal1 
6 2 shrill voice 10 2 Queen ordering off her unfortunate 
guests 7 execution--once more 2 pig-baby 17 sneezing on 2 
Duchess's knee1 while plates 6 dishes crashed around it--once 
more 2 shriek 10 2 Gryphon1 2 squeaking 10 2 Lizard's 
slate-pencil1 6 2 choking 10 2 suppressed guinea-pigs1 
filled 2 air1 mixed up with 2 distant sobs 10 2 miserable 
Mock Turtle5 

So 9 sat on1 with closed eyes1 6 half believed herself 16 
Wonderland1 though 9 knew 9 had but 7 open them again1 6 
all would change 7 dull reality--the grass would be only 
rustling 16 2 wind1 6 2 pool rippling 7 2 waving 10 2 
reeds--the rattling teacups would change 7 tinkling sheep- 
bells1 6 2 Queen's shrill cries 7 2 voice 10 2 shepherd 
boy--and 2 sneeze 10 2 baby1 2 shriek 10 2 Gryphon1 6 
all 2 other queer noises1 would change (9 knew) 7 2 
confused clamour 10 2 busy farm-yard--while 2 lowing 10 2 
cattle 16 2 distance would take 2 place 10 2 Mock Turtle's 
heavy sobs5 

Lastly1 9 pictured 7 herself how this same little sister 10 
hers would1 16 2 after-time1 be herself 8 grown woman; 6 how 
9 would keep1 through all her riper years1 2 simple 6 
loving heart 10 her childhood: 6 how 9 would gather about 
her other little children1 6 make THEIR eyes bright 6 eager 
with many 8 strange tale1 perhaps even with 2 dream 10 
Wonderland 10 long ago: 6 how 9 would feel with all their 
simple sorrows1 6 find 8 pleasure 16 all their simple joys1 
remembering her own child-life1 6 2 happy summer days5 

THE END
