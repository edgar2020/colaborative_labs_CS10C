THE SPOTTTER-INN 

ENTERING 12 gable 17ended Spouter-Inn1 you found 
yourself 8 6 wide1 low1 straggling entry 18 old-fashioned 
wainscots1 reminding one 5 2 bulwarks 5 some con17 
demned old craft3 On one side hung 6 very large oil17 
painting so thoroughly besmoked1 4 every way defaced1 
12 8 2 unequal cross-lights by which you viewed 141 
14 15 only by diligent study 4 6 series 5 systematic 
visits 7 141 4 careful inquiry 5 2 neighbours1 12 
you could any way arrive at an understanding 5 its 
purpose3 Such unaccountable masses 5 shades 4 
shadows1 12 at first you almost thought some ambitious 
young artist1 8 2 time 5 2 New England hags1 had 
endeavoured 7 delineate chaos bewitched3 But by dint 
5 much 4 earnest contemplation1 4 oft-repeated 
ponderings1 4 especially by throwing open 2 little 
window toward 2 back 5 2 entry1 you at last come 
7 2 conclusion 12 such an idea1 however wild1 might 
not be altogether unwarranted3 

But what most puzzled 4 confounded you 15 6 
long1 limber1 portentous1 black mass 5 something hover17 
ing 8 2 centre 5 2 picture over three blue1 dim1 
perpendicular lines floating 8 6 nameless yeast3 A boggy1 
soggy1 squitchy picture truly1 enough 7 drive 6 nervous 
man distracted3 Yet there 15 6 sort 5 indefinite1 half17 
attained1 unimaginable sublimity about 14 12 fairly 
froze you 7 141 till you 8 voluntarily1 took an oath 18

Ever 4 anon 6 bright1 but1 alas1 deceptive idea would 
dart you through3 It 9s 2 Black Sea 8 6 midnight gale3 
It 9s 2 unnatural combat 5 2 four primal elements3 
It 9s 6 blasted heath3 It 9s 6 Hyperborean winter scene3 
It 9s 2 breaking-up 5 2 ice-bound stream 5 Time3 
But at last all these fancies yielded 7 12 one portentous 
something 8 2 picture's midst3 That once found out1 
4 all 2 rest were plain3 But stop 11 does 14 not bear 
6 faint resemblance 7 6 gigantic fish ? even 2 great 
leviathan himself ? 

In fact1 2 artist's design seemed this : 6 final theory 
5 my own1 partly based upon 2 aggregated opinions 
5 many aged persons 18 whom 10 conversed upon 2 
subject3 The picture represents 6 Cape-Horner 8 6 great 
hurricane 11 2 half-foundered ship weltering there 18 
its three dismantled masts alone visible 11 4 an exasper17 
ated whale1 purposing 7 spring clean over 2 craft1 19 
8 2 enormous act 5 impaling himself upon 2 three 
mast-heads3 

The opposite wall 5 this entry 15 hung all over 18 
6 heathenish array 5 monstrous clubs 4 spears3 Some 
were thickly set 18 glittering teeth resembling ivory 
saws 11 others were tufted 18 knots 5 human hair 11 4 
one 15 sickle-shaped1 18 6 vast handle sweeping round 
like 2 segment made 8 2 new-mown grass by 6 long17 
armed mower3 You shuddered 20 you gazed1 4 
wondered what monstrous cannibal 4 savage could 
ever have gone 6 death-harvesting 18 such 6 hacking1 
horrifying implement3 Mixed 18 these were rusty 
old whaling-lances 4 harpoons all broken 4 deformed3 
Some were storied weapons3 With this once long lance1 
now wildly elbowed1 fifty years ago did Nathan Swain 
kill fifteen whales between 6 sunrise 4 6 sunset3 And

18 such low ponderous beams above1 4 such old

you trod some old craft's cockpits1 especially 5 such 6 
howling night1 when this corner-anchored old ark rocked

table covered 18 cracked glass cases1 filled 18 dusty

Projecting from 2 further angle 5 2 room stands 6 
dark-looking den 2 bar 6 rude attempt at 6 right

Supper over1 2 company went back 7 2 bar-room1

18 their heads muffled 8 woollen comforters1 all be17

7 congratulate myself upon 6 little plan 12 had occurred 
7 me just previous 7 2 entrance 5 2 seamen3 

No man prefers 7 sleep two 8 6 bed3 In fact1 you 
would 6 good deal rather not sleep 18 your own brother3 
10 don't know how 14 191 but people like 7 be private when 
they are sleeping3 And when 14 comes 7 sleeping 18 
an unknown stranger1 8 6 strange inn1 8 6 strange town1 
4 12 stranger 6 harpooneer1 then your objections 
indefinitely multiply3 Nor 15 there any earthly reason 
why 10 20 6 sailor should sleep two 8 6 bed1 more than 
anybody else 11 for sailors no more sleep two 8 6 bed at 
sea1 than bachelor kings do ashore3 To be sure1 they 
all sleep together 8 one apartment1 but you have your 
own hammock1 4 cover yourself 18 your own blanket1 
4 sleep 8 your own skin3 

The more 10 pondered over this harpooneer1 2 more 10 
abominated 2 thought 5 sleeping 18 him3 It 15 
fair 7 presume 12 being 6 harpooneer1 13 linen or 
woollen1 20 2 case might be1 would not be 5 2 tidiest1 
certainly none 5 2 finest3 10 began 7 twitch all over3 
Besides1 14 15 getting late1 4 my decent harpooneer 
ought 7 be home 4 going bedward3 Suppose now1 
16 should tumble 8 upon me at midnight how could 10 
tell from what vile hole 16 had been coming ? 

9 Landlord ! 10 Ve changed my mind about 12 
harpooneer3 10 shan't sleep 18 him3 10 911 try 2 bench 
here39 

9 Just 20 you please 11 10 9m sorry 10 can't spare ye 6

here 9 feeling 5 2 knots 4 notches3 9 But wait 
6 bit1 Skrimshander 11 10 Ve got 6 carpenter's plane there 
8 2 bar wait1 10 say1 4 10 911 make ye snug enough39 
So saying 16 procured 2 plane 11 4 18 13 old silk

planing away at my bed1 2 while grinning like an ape3

The shavings flew right 4 left 11 till at last 2 plane17 
iron came bump against an indestructible knot3 The 
landlord 15 near spraining 13 wrist1 4 10 told him for 
heaven's sake 7 quit 2 bed 15 soft enough 7 suit 
me1 4 10 did not know how all 2 planing 8 2 world 
could make eider down 5 6 pine plank3 So gathering 
up 2 shavings 18 another grin1 4 throwing them 
into 2 great stove 8 2 middle 5 2 room1 16 went 
about 13 business1 4 left me 8 6 brown study3 

10 now took 2 measure 5 2 bench1 4 found 12 
14 15 6 foot too short 11 but 12 could be mended 18 
6 chair3 But 14 15 6 foot too narrow1 4 2 other 
bench 8 2 room 15 about four inches higher than 2 
planed one so there 15 no yoking them3 10 then placed 
2 first bench lengthwise along 2 only clear space 
against 2 wall1 leaving 6 little interval between1 for my 
back 7 settle down 83 But 10 soon found 12 there 
came such 6 draught 5 cold air over me from under 2 
sill 5 2 window1 12 this plan would never do at all1 
especially 20 another current from 2 rickety door met 
2 one from 2 window1 4 both together formed 6 
series 5 small whirlwinds 8 2 immediate vicinity 5 2 
spot where 10 had thought 7 spend 2 night3 

The devil fetch 12 harpooneer1 thought 101 but stop1 
couldn't 10 steal 6 march on him bolt 13 door inside1 4 
jump into 13 bed1 not 7 be wakened by 2 most violent 
knockings ? It seemed no bad idea 11 but upon second 
thoughts 10 dismissed 143 For who could tell but what 
2 next morning1 so soon 20 10 popped out 5 2 room1 
2 harpooneer might be standing 8 2 entry1 all ready 
7 knock me down ! 

Still1 looking round me again1 4 seeing no possible 
chance 5 spending 6 sufferable night unless 8 some other 
person's bed1 10 began 7 think 12 after all 10 might be 
cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown

furniture belonging 7 2 place1 but 6 rude shelf1 2 four 
walls1 4 6 papered fire-board representing 6 man striking 
6 whale3 Of things not properly belonging 7 2 room1 
there 15 6 hammock lashed up1 4 thrown upon 2 
floor 8 one corner 11 also 6 large seaman's bag1 containing 
2 harpooneer's wardrobe1 no doubt 8 lieu 5 6 land trunk3

clusion concerning 143 10 can compare 14 7 nothing but 
6 large door-mat1 ornamented at 2 edges 18 little

round an Indian moccasin3 There 15 6 hole or slit 8

10 put 14 on1 7 try 141 4 14 weighed me down like 6 hamper1

thinking about this head-peddling harpooneer1 4 13 
door-mat3 After thinking some time on 2 bedside1 10 
got up 4 took off my monkey-jacket1 4 then stood 
8 2 middle 5 2 room thinking3 10 then took off my

beginning 7 feel very cold now1 half undressed 20 10 151 
4 remembering what 2 landlord said about 2 har17 
pooneer 9s not coming home at all 12 night1 14 being so 
very late1 10 made no more ado1 but jumped out 5 my 
pantaloons 4 boots1 4 then blowing out 2 light 
tumbled into bed1 4 commended myself 7 2 care 5 
heaven3 

Whether 12 mattress 15 stuffed 18 corn-cobs or 
broken crockery1 there 19 no telling1 but 10 rolled about 6 
good deal1 4 could not sleep for 6 long time3 At last 
10 slid off into 6 light doze1 4 had pretty nearly made 6 
good offing toward 2 land 5 Nod1 when 10 heard 6 
heavy footfall 8 2 passage1 4 saw 6 glimmer 5 light 
come into 2 room from under 2 door3 

Lord save me1 thinks 101 12 must be 2 harpooneer1 
2 infemal head-peddler3 But 10 lay perfectly still1 4 
resolved not 7 say 6 word till spoken 73 Holding 6

8 2 other1 2 stranger entered 2 room1 4 without 
looking toward 2 bed1 placed 13 candle 6 good way 
off from me on 2 floor 8 one corner1 4 then began 
working away at 2 knotted cords 5 2 large bag 10

moment 16 chanced 7 turn 13 face so toward 2 light1 
12 10 plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at 
all1 those black squares on 13 cheeks3 They were stains 
5 some sort or other3 At first 10 knew not what 7 make 
5 this 11 but soon an inkling 5 2 truth occurred 7 me3 
10 remembered 6 story 5 6 white man 6 whaleman too 
who1 falling among 2 cannibals1 had been tattooed by 
them3 10 concluded 12 this harpooneer1 8 2 course 5 
13 distant voyages1 must have met 18 6 similar adven17 
ture3 And what 19 141 thought 101 after all ! It 9s only 
13 outside 11 6 man can be honest 8 any sort 5 skin3 
But then1 what 7 make 5 13 unearthly complexion1 
12 part 5 141 10 mean1 lying round about1 4 completely 
independent 5 2 squares 5 tattooing3 To be sure1 14 
might be nothing but 6 good coat 5 tropical tanning 11 
but 10 never heard 5 6 hot sun's tanning 6 white man into 
6 purplish-yellow one3 However1 10 had never been 8 
2 South Seas 11 4 perhaps 2 sun there produced 
these extraordinary effects upon 2 skin3 Now1 while 
all these ideas were passing through me like lightning1 
this harpooneer never noticed me at all3 But1 after some 
difficulty having opened 13 bag1 16 commenced fumbling 
8 141 4 presently pulled out 6 sort 5 tomahawk1 4 
6 sealskin wallet 18 2 hair on3 Placing these on 2 
old chest 8 2 middle 5 2 room1 16 then took 2 New 
Zealand head 6 ghastly thing enough 4 crammed 14 
down into 2 bag3 He now took off 13 hat 6 new 
beaver hat when 10 came nigh singing out 18 fresh 
surprise3 There 15 no hair on 13 head none 7 speak 
51 at least nothing but 6 small scalp 17knot twisted up on 
13 forehead3 His bald purplish head now looked for 
all 2 world like 6 mildewed skull3 Had not the^stranger 
stood between me 4 2 door1 10 would have bolted out 
5 14 quicker than ever 10 bolted 6 dinner3

Even 20 14 151 10 thought something 5 slipping out 
5 2 window1 but 14 15 2 second floor back3 10 am 
no coward1 but what 7 make 5 this head-peddling purple 
rascal altogether passed my comprehension3 Ignorance1 
js^the parent^QJJear1 4 being completely nonplussed 
4 confounded about 2 stranger1 10 confess 10 15 now 
20 much afraid 5 him 20 if 14 15 2 devil himself who 
had thus broken into my room at 2 dead 5 night3 In 
fact1 10 15 so afraid 5 him 12 10 15 not game enough 
just then 7 address him1 4 demand 6 satisfactory 
answer concerning what seemed inexplicable 8 him3 

Meanwhile1 16 continued 2 business 5 undressing1 
4 at last showed 13 chest 4 arms3 As 10 live1 these 
covered parts 5 him were checkered 18 2 same 
squares 20 13 face 11 13 back1 too1 15 all over 2 same 
dark squares 11 16 seemed 7 have been 8 6 Thirty Years9 
War1 4 just escaped from 14 18 6 sticking-plaster shirt3 
Still more1 13 very legs were marked1 20 if 6 parcel 5 
dark green frogs were running up 2 trunks 5 young 
palms3 It 15 now quite plain 12 16 must be some 
abominable savage or other shipped aboard 5 6 whale17 
man 8 2 South Seas1 4 so landed 8 this Christian 
country3 10 quaked 7 think 5 143 A peddler 5 heads too 
perhaps 2 heads 5 13 own brothers3 He might take 
6 fancy 7 mine heavens ! look at 12 tomahawk ! 

But there 15 no time for shuddering1 for now 2 
savage went about something 12 completely fascinated 
my attention1 4 convinced me 12 16 must indeed be 
6 heathen3 Going 7 13 heavy grego1 or wrapall1 or 
dreadnaught1 which 16 had previously hung on 6 chair1 
16 fumbled 8 2 pockets1 4 produced at length 6 
curious little deformed image 18 6 hunch on its back1 
4 exactly 2 colour 5 6 three-days-old Congo baby3 
Remembering 2 embalmed head1 at first 10 almost 
thought 12 this black manikin 15 6 real baby pre17

served 8 some similar manner3 But seeing 12 14 15 
not at all limber1 4 12 14 glistened 6 good deal like 
polished ebony1 10 concluded 12 14 must be nothing but 
6 wooden idol1 which indeed 14 proved 7 be3 For now 
2 savage goes up 7 2 empty fire-place1 4 removing 
2 papered fire 17board1 sets up this little hunchbacked 
image1 like 6 ten-pin1 between 2 andirons3 The chimney 
jambs 4 all 2 bricks inside were very sooty1 so 12 
10 thought this fire-place made 6 very appropriate little 
shrine or chapel for 13 Congo idol3 

10 now screwed my eyes hard toward 2 half-hidden 
image1 feeling but ill at ease meantime 7 see what 15 
next 7 follow3 First 16 takes about 6 double handful 
5 shavings out 5 13 grego pocket1 4 places them 
carefully before 2 idol 11 then laying 6 bit 5 ship 17biscuit 
on top 4 applying 2 flame from 2 lamp1 16 kindled 
<2 shavings into 6 sacrificial blaze3 Presently1 after 
many hasty snatches into 2 fire1 4 still hastier 1817 
drawals 5 13 fingers (whereby 16 seemed 7 be scorching 
them badly)1 16 at last succeeded 8 drawing out 2 
biscuit 11 then blowing off 2 heat 4 ashes 6 little1 
16 made 6 polite offer 5 14 7 2 little negro3 But 2 
little devil did not seem 7 fancy such dry sort 5 fare at 
all 11 16 never moved 13 lips3 All these strange antics 
were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from 
2 devotee1 who seemed 7 be praying 8 6 sing-song 
or else singing some pagan psalmody or other1 during 
which 13 face twitched about 8 2 most unnatural 
manner3 At last1 extinguishing 2 fire1 16 took 2 idol 
up very unceremoniously1 4 bagged 14 again 8 13 
grego pocket 20 carelessly 20 if 16 were 6 sportsman 
bagging 6 dead woodcock3

so long been bound3 

But 2 interval 10 spent 8 deliberating what 7 say 
15 6 fatal one3 Taking up 13 tomahawk from 2 table1 
16 examined 2 head 5 14 for an instant1 4 then hold17

sang out1 10 could not help 14 now 11 4 giving 6 sudden

Stammering out something1 10 knew not what1 10 rolled 
away from him against 2 wall1 4 then conjured him1 
whoever or whatever 16 might be1 7 keep quiet1 4 let 
me get up 4 light 2 lamp again3 But 13 guttural 
responses satisfied me at once 12 16 but ill compre17 
hended my meaning3 

9 Who-e debel you ? 9 16 at last said 9 you no speak-e1 
dam-me1 10 kill-e39 And so saying 2 lighted tomahawk 
began flourishing about me 8 2 dark3 

4 Landlord1 for God's sake1 Peter Coffin ! 9 shouted 103 
9 Landlord ! Watch ! Coffin ! Angels ! save me ! 9 

1 Speak-e ! tell-ee me who-ee be1 or dam-me1 10 kill-e ! 9 
again growled 2 cannibal1 while 13 horrid flourishings 
5 2 tomahawk scattered 2 hot tobacco ashes about 
me till 10 thought my linen would get on fire3 But thank

CHAPTER IV 

THE COUNTERPANE 

UPON waking next morning about daylight1 10 found 
Queequeg's arm thrown over me 8 2 most loving 4 
affectionate manner3 You had almost thought 10 had 
been 13 wife3 The counterpane 15 5 patchwork1 full 
5 odd little parti-coloured squares 4 triangles 11 4 
this arm 5 13 tattooed all over 18 an interminable 
Cretan labyrinth 5 6 figure1 no two parts 5 which were 
5 one precise shade owing1 10 suppose1 7 13 keeping 
13 arm at sea unmethodically 8 sun 4 shade1 13 
shirt-sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times 
this same arm 5 131 10 say1 looked for all 2 world like 
6 strip 5 12 same patchwork quilt3 Indeed1 partly 
lying on 14 20 2 arm did when 10 first awoke1 10 could 
hardly tell 14 from 2 quilt1 they so blended their hues 
together 11 4 14 15 only by 2 sense 5 weight 4 
pressure 12 10 could tell 12 Queequeg 15 hugging me3 
My sensations were strange3 Let me try 7 explain 
them3 When 10 15 6 child1 10 well remember 6 somewhat 
similar circumstance 12 befell me 11 whether 14 15 6 
reality or 6 dream1 10 never could entirely settle3 The 
circumstance 15 this3 10 had been cutting up some 
caper or other 10 think 14 15 trying 7 crawl up 2 
chimney1 20 10 had seen 6 little sweep do 6 few days 
previous 11 4 my stepmother1 who1 somehow or other1 
15 all 2 time whipping me1 or sending me 7 bed 
supperless1 my mother dragged me by 2 legs out 
5 2 chimney 4 packed me off 7 bed1 though 14 15 
only two o'clock 8 2 afternoon 5 2 21st June1 2

longest day 8 2 year 8 our hemisphere3 1 felt dread17 
fully3 But there 15 no help for 141 so upstairs 10 went 
7 my little room 8 2 third floor1 undressed myself 20 
slowly 20 possible so 20 7 kill time1 4 18 6 bitter 
sigh got between 2 sheets3 

10 lay there dismally calculating 12 sixteen entire 
hours must elapse before 10 could hope for 6 resurrection3 
Sixteen hours 8 bed ! 2 small 5 my back ached 7 
think 5 143 And 14 15 so light too 11 2 sun shining 
8 at 2 window1 4 6 great rattling 5 coaches 8 2 
streets1 4 2 sound 5 gay voices all over 2 house3 
10 felt worse 4 worse at last 10 got up1 dressed1 4 
softly going down 8 my stockinged feet1 sought out my 
stepmother1 4 suddenly threw myself at her feet1 be17 
seeching her 20 6 particular favour 7 give me 6 good 
slippering for my misbehaviour 11 anything indeed but con17 
demning me 7 lie abed such an unendurable length 5 
time3 But she 15 2 best 4 most conscientious 5 
stepmothers1 4 back 10 had 7 go 7 my room3 For 
several hours 10 lay there broad awake1 feeling 6 great 
deal worse than 10 have ever done since1 even from 2 
greatest subsequent misfortunes3 At last 10 must have 
fallen into 6 troubled nightmare 5 6 doze 11 4 slowly 
waking from 14 half steeped 8 dreams 10 opened my 
eyes1 4 2 before sunlit room 15 now wrapped 8 
outer darkness3 Instantly 10 felt 6 shock running through 
all my frame 11 nothing 15 7 be seen1 4 nothing 15 
7 be heard 11 but 6 supernatural hand seemed placed 
8 mine3 My arm hung over 2 counterpane1 4 2 
nameless1 unimaginable1 silent form or phantom1 7 which 
2 hand belonged1 seemed closely seated by my bedside3 
For what seemed ages piled on ages1 10 lay there1 frozen 
18 2 most awful fears1 not daring 7 drag away my 
hand 11 yet ever thinking 12 if 10 could but stir 14 one 
single inch1 2 horrid spell would be broken3 10 knew

not how this consciousness at last glided away from me 11 
but waking 8 2 morning1 10 shudderingly remembered 
14 all1 4 for days 4 weeks 4 months afterward 10 
lost myself 8 confounding attempts 7 explain 2 mystery3 
Nay1 7 this very hour1 10 often puzzle myself 18 143 

Now1 take away 2 awful fear1 4 my sensations at 
feeling 2 supernatural hand 8 mine were very similar1 
8 their strangeness1 7 those which 10 experienced on 
waking up 4 seeing Queequeg 9s pagan arm thrown 
round me3 But at length all 2 past night's events 
soberly recurred1 one by one1 8 fixed reality1 4 then 10 
lay only alive 7 2 comical predicament3 For though 
10 tried 7 move 13 arm unlock 13 bridegroom clasp 
yet1 sleeping 20 16 151 16 still hugged me tightly1 20 
though naught but death should part us twain3 10 now 
strove 7 rouse him * Queequeg ! 9 but 13 only answer 
15 6 snore3 10 then rolled over1 my neck feeling 20 if 
14 were 8 6 horse-collar 11 4 suddenly felt 6 slight 
scratch3 Throwing aside 2 counterpane1 there lay 2 
tomahawk sleeping by 2 savage's side1 20 if 14 were 6 
hatchet 17faced baby3 A pretty pickle1 truly1 thought 10 11 
abed here 8 6 strange house 8 2 broad day1 18 6 
cannibal 4 6 tomahawk ! 9 Queequeg ! 8 2 name 
5 goodness1 Queequeg1 wake ! 9 At length1 by dint 5 
much wriggling1 4 loud 4 incessant expostulations 
upon 2 unbecomingness 5 13 hugging 6 fellow-male 8 
12 matrimonial sort 5 style1 10 succeeded 8 extracting 
6 grunt 11 4 presently1 16 drew back 13 arm1 shook 
himself all over like 6 Newfoundland dog just from 2 
water1 4 sat up 8 bed1 stiff 20 6 pikestaff1 looking at 
me1 4 rubbing 13 eyes 20 if 16 did not altogether re17 
member how 10 came 7 be there1 though 6 dim conscious17

dawning over him3 Meanwhile1 10 lay quietly eyeing him1

skylarking 18 me not 6 little 8 2 matter 5 my 
bedfellow3 

However1 6 good laugh 19 6 mighty good thing1 4 
rather too scarce 6 good thing 11 2 more 9s 2 pity3 So1 
if any one man1 8 13 own proper person1 afford stuff for 
6 good joke 7 anybody1 let him not be backward1 but let 
him cheerfully allow himself 7 spend 4 be spent 8 
12 way3 And 2 man 12 has anything bountifully 
laughable about him1 be sure there 19 more 8 12 man 
than you perhaps think for3 

The bar-room 15 now full 5 2 boarders who had been 
dropping 8 2 night previous1 4 whom 10 had not 20 
yet had 6 good look at3 They were nearly all whalemen 11

tropic tawn1 but slightly bleached withal 11 lie doubtless 
has tarried whole weeks ashore3 But who could show 6 
cheek like Queequeg ? which1 barred 18 various tints1 
seemed like 2 Andes9 western slope1 7 show forth 8 
one array1 contrasting climates1 zone by zone3 

9 Grub1 ho ! 9 now cried 2 landlord1 flinging open 6 
door1 4 8 we went 7 breakfast3 

They say 12 men who have seen 2 world1 thereby 
become quite at ease 8 manner1 quite self-possessed 8 
company3 Not always1 though : Ledyard1 2 great New 
England traveller1 4 Mungo Park1 2 Scotch one 11 5 
all men1 they possessed 2 least assurance 8 2 parlour3 
But perhaps 2 mere crossing 5 Siberia 8 6 sledge 
drawn by dogs 20 Ledyard did1 or 2 taking 6 long solitary 
walk on an empty stomach1 8 2 negro heart 5 Africa1 
which 15 2 sum 5 poor Mungo 9s performances this 
kind 5 travel1 10 say1 may not be 2 very best mode 5 
attaining 6 high social polish3 Still1 for 2 most part1 
12 sort 5 thing 19 7 be had anywhere3 

These reflections just here are occasioned by 2 cir17 
cumstance 12 after we were all seated at 2 table1 4 
10 15 preparing 7 hear some good stories about whaling 11 
7 my no small surprise nearly every man maintained 6 
profound silence3 And not only 121 but they looked 
embarrassed3 Yes1 here were 6 set 5 sea-dogs1 many 5 
whom without 2 slightest bashfulness had boarded 
great whales on 2 high seas entire strangers 7 them 
4 duelled them dead without winking 11 4 yet1 here 
they sat at 6 social breakfast table all 5 2 same calling1 
all 5 kindred tastes looking round 20 sheepishly at 
each other 20 though they had never been out 5 sight 
5 some sheepfold among 2 Green Mountains3 A 
curious sight 11 these bashful bears1 these timid warrior 
whalemen !

But 20 for Queequeg why1 Queequeg sat there among 
them at 2 head 5 2 table1 too1 14 so chanced 20 
cool 20 an icicle3 To be sure1 10 cannot say much for 13 
breeding3 His greatest admirer could not have cordially 
justified 13 bringing 13 harpoon 8 7 breakfast 18 him1 
4 using 14 there without ceremony 11 reaching over 2 
table 18 141 7 2 imminent jeopardy 5 many heads1 
4 grappling 2 beefsteaks toward him3 But 12 
15 certainly very coolly done by him1 4 everyone 
knows 12 8 most people's estimation1 7 do anything 
coolly 19 7 do 14 genteelly3 

We will not speak 5 all Queequeg's peculiarities here 11 
how 16 eschewed coffee 4 hot rolls1 4 applied 13 
undivided attention 7 beefsteaks1 done rare3 Enough1 
12 when breakfast 15 over 16 withdrew like 2 rest 
into 2 public room1 lighted 13 tomahawk-pipe1 4 15 
sitting there quietly digesting 4 smoking 18 13 
inseparable hat on1 when 10 sallied out for 6 stroll3 



CHAPTER VI 

THE STREET 

IF 10 had been astonished at first catching 6 glimpse 5 so 
outlandish an individual 20 Queequeg circulating among 
2 polite society 5 6 civilised town1 12 astonishment 
soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through 
2 streets 5 New Bedford3 

In thoroughfares nigh 2 docks1 any considerable sea17 
port will frequently offer 7 view 2 queerest 17looking 
nondescripts from foreign parts3 Even 8 Broadway 
4 Chestnut Streets1 Mediterranean mariners will some17 
times jostle 2 affrighted ladies3 Regent Street 19 not 
unknown 7 Lascars 4 Malays 11 4 at Bombay1 8 2 
Apollo Green1 live Yankees have often scared 2 natives3 
But New Bedford beats all Water Street 4 Wapping3 
In these last 17mentioned haunts you see only sailors 11 but 
8 New Bedford actual cannibals stand chatting at street 
corners 11 savages outright 11 many 5 whom yet carry on 
their bones unholy flesh3 It makes 6 stranger stare3 

But1 besides 2 Feegeeans1 Tongatabooarrs1 Erro17 
manggoans1 Pannangians1 4 Brighggians1 4 besides 
2 wild specimens 5 2 whaling 17craft which unheeded 
reel about 2 streets1 you will see other sights still more 
curious1 certainly more comical3 There weekly arrive 
8 this town scores 5 green Vermonters 4 New Hamp17 
shire men1 all athirst for gain 4 glory 8 2 fishery3 
They are mostly young1 5 stalwart frames 11 fellows who 
have felled forests1 4 now seek 7 drop 2 axe 4 
snatch 2 whale-lance3 Many are 20 green 20 2 Green

Mountains whence they came3 In some things you would 
think them but 6 few hours old3 Look there ! 12 chap 
strutting round 2 corner3 He wears 6 beaver hat 4 
swallow-tailed coat1 girdled 18 6 sailor 17belt 4 6 sheath17 
knife3 Here comes another 18 6 sou 917wester 4 6 
bombazine cloak3 

No town-bred dandy will compare 18 6 country-bred 
one 10 mean 6 downright bumpkin dandy 6 fellow 121 
8 2 dog-days1 will mow 13 two acres 8 buckskin 
gloves for fear 5 tanning 13 hands3 Now when 6 country 
dandy like this takes 14 into 13 head 7 make 6 distin17 
guished reputation1 4 joins 2 great whale-fishery1 you 
should see 2 comical things 16 does upon reaching 2 
seaport3 In bespeaking 13 sea 17out fit1 16 orders bell17 
buttons 7 13 waistcoats 11 straps 7 13 canvas trowsers3 
Ah1 poor Hay-Seed ! how bitterly will burst those straps 
8 2 first howling gale1 when thou art driven1 straps/ 
buttons1 4 all1 down 2 throat 5 2 tempest3 

But think not 12 this famous town has only har17 
pooneers1 cannibals1 4 bumpkins 7 show her visitors3 
Not at all3 Still New Bedford 19 6 queer place3 Had 14 
not been for us whalemen1 12 tract 5 land would this 
day perhaps have been 8 20 howling condition 20 2 
coast 5 Labrador3 As 14 191 parts 5 her back country 
are enough 7 frighten one1 they look so bony3 The town 
itself 19 perhaps 2 dearest place 7 live 81 hi all New 
England3 It 19 6 land 5 oil1 true enough : but not like 
Caanan 11 6 land1 also1 5 corn 4 wine3 The streets do 
not run 18 milk 11 nor 8 2 spring-time do they pave 
them 18 fresh eggs3 Yet1 8 spite 5 this1 nowhere 8 
all America will you find more patrician-like houses 11 
parks 4 gardens more opulent1 than hi New Bedford3 
Whence came they ? how planted upon this once scraggy 
scoria 5 6 country ? 

Go 4 gaze upon 2 iron emblematical harpoons 






THE STREET 41 

round yonder lofty mansion1 4 your question will be 
answered3 Yes 11 all these brave houses 4 flowery 
gardens came from 2 Atlantic1 Pacific1 4 Indian oceans3 
One 4 all1 they were harpooned 4 dragged up hither 
from 2 bottom 5 2 sea3 Can Herr Alexander per17 
form 6 feat like 12 ? 

In New Bedford1 fathers1 they say1 give whales for 
dowers 7 their daughters1 4 portion off their nieces 
18 6 few porpoises apiece3 You must go 7 New Bed17 
ford 7 see 6 brilliant wedding 11 for1 they say1 they have 
reservoirs 5 oil 8 every house1 4 every night recklessly 
burn their lengths 8 spermaceti candles3 

In summer time1 2 town 19 sweet 7 see 11 full 5 fine 
maples long avenues 5 green 4 gold3 And 8 August1 
high 8 air1 2 beautiful 4 bountiful horse-chestnuts1 
candelabra-wise1 proffer 2 passer-by their tapering 
upright cones 5 congregated blossoms3 So omnipotent \ 
19 art 11 which 8 many 6 district 5 New Bedford has 
superinduced bright terraces 5 flowers upon 2 barren 
refuse rocks thrown aside at Creation's final day3 

And 2 women 5 New Bedford1 they bloom like their 
own red roses3 But roses only bloom 8 summer 11 whereas 
2 fine carnation 5 their cheeks 19 perennial 20 sunlight 
8 2 seventh heavens3 Elsewhere match 12 bloom 
5 theirs1 ye cannot1 save 8 Salem1 where they tell me 
2 young girls breathe such musk1 their sailor sweet17 
hearts smell them miles off shore1 20 though they were 
drawing nigh 2 odorous Moluccas instead 5 2 Puritanic

CHAPTER VII 

THE CHAPEL 

IN this same New Bedford there stands 6 Whaleman's 
Chapel1 4 few are 2 moody fishermen1 shortly bound 
for 2 Indian Ocean or Pacific1 who fail 7 make 6 Sunday 
visit 7 2 spot3 10 am sure 12 10 did not3 

Returning from my first morning stroll1 10 again sallied 
out upon this special errand3 The sky had changed from 
clear1 sunny cold1 7 driving sleet 4 mist3 Wrapping 
myself 8 my shaggy jacket 5 2 cloth called bearskin1 
10 fought my way against 2 stubborn storm3 Entering1 
10 found 6 small scattered congregation 5 sailors1 4 
sailors9 wives 4 widows3 A muffled silence reigned1 
only broken at times by 2 shrieks 5 2 storm3 Each 
silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from 
2 other1 20 if each silent grief were insular 4 incom17 
municable3 The chaplain had not yet arrived 11 4 there 
these silent islands 5 men 4 women sat steadfastly 
eyeing several marble tablets1 18 black borders1 masoned 
into 2 wall on either side 2 pulpit3 Three 5 them 
ran something like 2 following1 but 10 do not pretend 7

CHAPTER VIII 

THE PULPIT 

10 HAD not been seated very long ere 6 man 5 6 certain 
venerable robustness entered 11 immediately 20 2 storm17 
pelted door flew back upon admitting him1 6 quick regard17 
ful eyeing 5 him by all 2 congregation sufficiently 
attested 12 this fine old man 15 2 chaplain3 Yes1 
14 15 2 famous Father Mapple1 so called by 2 whale17 
men1 among whom 16 15 6 very great favourite3 He 
had been 6 sailor 4 6 harpooneer 8 13 youth1 but for 
many years past had dedicated 13 life 7 2 ministry3 
At 2 time 10 now write 51 Father Mapple 15 8 2 
hardy winter 5 6 healthy old age 11 12 sort 5 old age 
which seems merging into 6 second flowering youth1 for 
among all 2 fissures 5 13 wrinkles1 there shone certain 
mild gleams 5 6 newly developing bloom 2 spring 
verdure peeping forth even beneath February's snow3 
No one having previously heard 13 history1 could for 
2 first time behold Father Mapple without 2 utmost 
interest1 because there were certain engrafted clerical 
peculiarities about him1 imputable 7 12 adventurous 
maritime life 16 had led3 When 16 entered 10 observed 
12 16 carried no umbrella1 4 certainly had not come 
8 13 carriage1 for 13 tarpaulin hat ran down 18 melting 
sleet1 4 13 great pilot-cloth jacket seemed almost 7 
drag him 7 2 floor 18 2 weight 5 2 water 14 had 
absorbed3 However1 hat 4 coat 4 overshoes were 
one by one removed1 4 hung up 8 6 little space 8 an 
adjacent corner 11 when1 arrayed 8 6 decent suit1 16 
quietly approached 2 pulpit3

THE PULPIT 47 

Like most old-fashioned pulpits1 14 15 6 very lofty one1 
4 since 6 regular stairs 7 such 6 height would1 by its 
long angle 18 2 floor1 seriously contract 2 already 
small area 5 2 chapel1 2 architect1 14 seemed1 had 
acted upon 2 hint 5 Father Mapple1 4 finished 2 
pulpit without 6 stairs1 substituting 6 perpendicular side 
ladder1 like those used 8 mounting 6 ship from 6 boat at 
sea3 The wife 5 6 whaling-captain had provided 2 chapel 
18 6 handsome pair 5 red worsted man-ropes for this 
ladder1 which1 being itself nicely headed1 4 stained 18 
6 mahogany colour1 2 whole contrivance1 considering 
what manner 5 chapel 14 151 seemed by no means 8 bad 
taste3 Halting for an instant at 2 foot 5 2 ladder1 
4 18 both hands grasping 2 ornamental knobs 
5 2 man-ropes1 Father Mapple cast 6 look upward1 
4 then 18 6 truly sailor-like but still reverential 
dexterity1 hand over hand1 mounted 2 steps 20 if 
ascending 2 main 17top 5 13 vessel3 

The perpendicular parts 5 this side ladder1 20 19 usually 
2 case 18 swinging ones1 were 5 cloth-covered rope1 
only 2 rounds were 5 wood1 so 12 at every step there 
15 6 joint3 At my first glimpse 5 2 pulpit1 14 had not 
escaped me 12 however convenient for 6 ship1 these 
joints 8 2 present instance seemed unnecessary3 For 
10 15 not prepared 7 see Father Mapple after gaining 
2 height1 slowly turn round1 4 stooping over 2 
pulpit1 deliberately drag up 2 ladder step by step1 till 
2 whole 15 deposited within1 leaving him impregnable 
8 13 little Quebec3 

10 pondered some time without fully comprehending 
2 reason for this3 Father Mapple enjoyed such 6 wide 
reputation for sincerity 4 sanctity1 12 10 could not 
suspect him 5 courting notoriety by any mere tricks 5 
2 stage3 No1 thought 101 there must be some sober 
reason for this thing 11 furthermore1 14 must symbolise

something unseen3 Can 14 be1 then1 12 by 12 act 5 
physical isolation1 16 signifies 13 spiritual withdrawal for 
2 time1 from all outward worldly ties 4 connections ? 
Yes1 for replenished 18 2 meat 4 wine 5 2 word1 
7 2 faithful man 5 God1 this pulpit1 10 see1 19 6 self17 
containing stronghold 6 lofty Ehrenbreitstein1 18 6 
perennial well 5 water within 2 walls3 

But 2 side ladder 15 not 2 only strange feature 
5 2 place1 borrowed from 2 chaplain's former sea17 
farings3 Between 2 marble cenotaphs on either hand 
5 2 pulpit1 2 wall which formed its back 15 adorned 
18 6 large painting representing 6 gallant ship beating 
against 6 terrible storm off 6 lee coast 5 black rocks 4 
snowy breakers3 But high above 2 flying scud 4 
dark-rolling clouds1 there floated 6 little isle 5 sunlight1 
from which beamed forth an angel's face 11 4 this bright 
face shed 6 distinct spot 5 radiance upon 2 ship's tossed 
deck1 something like 12 silver plate now inserted into 2 
Victory's plank where Nelson fell3 9 Ah1 noble ship/ 2 
angel seemed 7 say1 9beat on1 beat on1 thou noble ship1 4 
bear 6 hardy helm 11 for lo ! 2 sun 19 breaking through 11 
2 clouds are rolling off serenest azure 19 at hand39 

Nor 15 2 pulpit itself without 6 trace 5 2 same 
sea 17taste 12 had achieved 2 ladder 4 2 picture3 
Its panelled front 15 8 2 likeness 5 6 ship's bluff bows1 
4 2 Holy Bible rested on 6 projecting piece 5 scroll 
work1 fashioned after 6 ship's fiddle 17headed beak3 

What could be more full 5 meaning ? for 2 pulpit 
19 ever this earth's foremost part 11 all 2 rest comes 8 
its rear 11 2 pulpit leads 2 world3 From thence 14 19 
2 storm 5 God's quick wrath 19 first descried1 4 2 
bow must bear 2 earliest brunt3 From thence 14 19 2 
God 5 breezes fair or foul 19 first invoked for favourable 
winds3 Yes1 2 world 9s 6 ship on its passage out1 4 
not 6 voyage complete 11 4 2 pulpit 19 its prow3

10 soon engaged 13 interest 11 4 from 12 we went 7

smoke 11 41 producing 13 pouch 4 tomahawk1 16 
quietly offered me 6 puff3 And then we sat exchanging 
puffs from 12 wild pipe 5 131 4 keeping 14 regularly

If there yet lurked any ice 5 indifference toward me

premature1 6 thing 7 be much distrusted 11 but 8 this 
simple savage those old rules would not apply3 

After supper1 4 another social chat 4 smoke1 we

for me 7 join him 11 but well knowing what 15 7 follow1 
10 deliberated 6 moment whether1 8 case 16 invited me1 
10 would comply or otherwise3 

10 15 6 good Christian 11 born 4 bred 8 2 bosom 
5 2 infallible Presbyterian Church3 How then could 
10 unite 18 this wild idolater 8 worshipping 13 piece 5 
wood ? But what 19 worship ? thought 103 Do you 
suppose now1 Ishmael1 12 2 magnanimous God 5 
heaven 4 earth pagans 4 all included can possibly 
be jealous 5 an insignificant bit 5 black wood ? Im17 
possible ! But what 19 worship ? 7 do 2 will 5 
God ? 12 19 worship3 And what 19 2 will 5 God ? 
7 do 7 my fellow-man what 10 would have my fellow-man

would do 7 me ? Why1 unite 18 me 8 my particular

So 10 kindled 2 shavings 11 helped prop up 2 innocent 
little idol 11 offered him burnt biscuit 18 Queequeg 11 
salaamed before him twice or thrice 11 kissed 13 nose 11 
4 12 done1 we undressed 4 went 7 bed1 at peace 
18 our own consciences 4 all 2 world3 But we 
did not go 7 sleep without some little chat3 

How 14 19 10 know not 11 but there 19 no place like 6 bed 
for confidential disclosures between friends3 Man 4

Nothing exists 8 itself3 If you flatter yourself 12 you

NEXT morning1 Monday1 after disposing 5 2 embalmed 
head 7 6 barber1 for 6 block1 10 settled my own 4 com17 
rade's bill 11 using1 however1 my comrade's money3 The 
grinning landlord1 20 well 20 2 boarders1 seemed amaz17 
ingly tickled at 2 sudden friendship which had sprung 
up between me 4 Queequeg especially 20 Peter Coffin's 
cock-and-bull stories about him had previously so much 
alarmed me concerning 2 very person whom 10 now 
companied 183 

We borrowed 6 wheelbarrow1 4 embarking our 
things1 including my own poor carpet-bag1 4 Quee17 
queg 9s canvas sack 4 hammock1 away we went down 7 
2 Moss1 2 little Nantucket packet schooner moored 
at 2 wharf3 As we were going along 2 people stared 11 
not at Queequeg so much for they were used 7 seeing 
cannibals like him 8 their streets1 but at seeing him 
4 me upon such confidential terms3 But we heeded 
them not1 going along wheeling 2 barrow by turns1 
4 Queequeg now 4 then stopping 7 adjust 2 sheath 
on 13 harpoon barbs3 10 asked him why 16 carried such 
6 troublesome thing 18 him ashore1 4 whether all 
whaling-ships did not find their own harpoons3 To this1 
8 substance1 16 replied1 12 though what 10 hinted 15 
true enough1 yet 16 had 6 particular affection for 13 own 
harpoon1 because 14 15 5 assured stuff1 well tried 8

their own scythes though 8 no wise obliged 7 furnish 
them even so1 Queequeg1 for 13 own private reasons1 
preferred 13 own harpoon3 

Shifting 2 barrow from my hand 7 131 16 told me 
6 funny story about 2 first wheelbarrow 16 had ever 
seen3 It 15 8 Sag Harbour3 The owners 5 13 ship1 
14 seems1 had lent him one1 8 which 7 carry 13 heavy

2 thing though 8 truth 16 15 entirely so1 concerning 
2 precise way 8 which 7 manage 2 barrow Quee17

said 101 9 Queequeg1 you might have known better than 
121 one would think3 Didn't 2 people laugh ? 9 

Upon this1 16 told me another story3 The people 
5 13 island 5 Rokovoko1 14 seems1 at their wedding 
feasts express 2 fragrant water 5 young cocoa-nuts into 
6 large stained calabash like 6 punch 17bowl 11 4 this 
punch 17bowl always forms 2 great central ornament on 
2 braided mat where 2 feast 19 held3 Now 6 certain 
grand merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko1 4 its 
commander from all accounts 6 very stately punctilious 
gentleman1 at least for 6 sea-captain this commander 
15 invited 7 2 wedding feast 5 Queequeg 9s sister1 6 
pretty young princess just turned 5 ten3 Well 11 when all 
2 wedding guests were assembled at 2 bride's bamboo 
cottage1 this captain marches 81 4 being assigned 2 
post 5 honour1 placed himself over against 2 punch17

At last1 passage paid1 4 luggage safe1 we stood on 
board 2 schooner3 Hoisting sail1 14 glided down 2 
Acushnet river3 On one side1 New Bedford rose 8

In olden times an eagle swooped down upon 2 New 
England coast1 4 carried off an infant Indian 8 13 
talons3 With loud lament 2 parents saw their child 
borne out 5 sight over 2 wide waters3 They resolved 
7 follow 8 2 same direction3 Setting out 8 their 
canoes1 after 6 perilous passage they discovered 2 
island1 4 there they found an empty ivory casket1 
2 poor little Indian's skeleton3 

What wonder1 then1 12 these Nantucketers1 born on 
6 beach1 should take 7 2 sea for 6 livelihood ! They 
first caught crabs 4 quohogs 8 2 sand 11 grown 
bolder1 they waded out 18 nets for mackerel 11 more 
experienced1 they pushed off 8 boats 4 captured cod 11 
4 at last1 launching 6 navy 5 great ships on 2 sea1 
explored this watery world 11 put an incessant belt 5 cir17

And thus have these naked Nantucketers1 these sea17

4 conquered 2 watery world like so many Alexanders 11 
parcelling out among them 2 Atlantic1 Pacific1 4

CHAPTER XV 

CHOWDER 

IT 15 quite late 8 2 evening when 2 little Moss came 
snugly 7 anchor1 4 Queequeg 4 10 went ashore 11 so 
we could attend 7 no business 12 day1 at least none 
but 6 supper 4 6 bed3 The landlord 5 2 Spouter17 
Inn had recommended us 7 13 cousin Hosea Hussey 
5 2 Try Pots1 whom 16 asserted 7 be 2 proprietor 
5 one 5 2 best kept hotels 8 all Nantucket1 4 more17 
over 16 had assured us 12 Cousin Hosea1 20 16 called 
him1 15 famous for 13 chowders3 In short1 16 plainly 
hinted 12 we could not possibly do better than try pot17 
luck at 2 Try Pots3 But 2 directions 16 had given 
us about keeping 6 yellow warehouse on our starboard 
hand till we opened 6 white church 7 2 larboard1 4 
then keeping 12 on 2 larboard hand till we made 6 
corner three points 7 2 starboard1 4 12 done1 
then ask 2 first man we met where 2 place 15 : these 
crooked directions 5 13 very much puzzled us at first1 
especially 201 at 2 outset1 Queequeg insisted 12 2 
yellow warehouse our first point 5 departure must be 
left on 2 larboard hand1 whereas 10 had understood 
Peter Coffin 7 say 14 15 on 2 starboard3 However1 
by dint 5 beating about 6 little 8 2 dark1 4 now 4 
then knocking up 6 peaceable inhabitant 7 inquire 2 
way1 we at last came 7 something which there 15 no 
mistaking3 

Two enormous wooden pots painted black1 4 sus17 
pended by asses9 ears1 swung from 2 cross-trees 5 an

old topmast1 planted 8 front 5 an old doorway3 The 
horns 5 2 cross-trees were sawed off on 2 other side1 
so 12 this old topmast looked not 6 little like 6 gallows3 
Perhaps 10 15 over-sensitive 7 such impressions at 2 
time1 but 10 could not help staring at this gallows 18 6 
vague misgiving3 A sort 5 crick 15 8 my neck 20 10 
gazed up 7 2 two remaining horns 11 yes1 two 5 them1 
one for Queequeg1 4 one for me3 It 9s ominous1 thinks 
103 A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing 8 my first 
whaling port 11 tombstones staring at me 8 2 whale17 
man's chapel 11 4 here 6 gallows ! 4 6 pair 5 pro17 
digious black pots too ! Are these last throwing out 
oblique hints touching Tophet ? 

10 15 called from these reflections by 2 sight 5 6 
freckled woman 18 yellow hair 4 6 yellow gown1 
standing 8 2 porch 5 2 inn1 under 6 dull red lamp 
swinging there1 12 looked much like an injured eye1 
4 carrying on 6 brisk scolding 18 6 man 8 6 purple 
woollen shirt3 

1 Get along 18 ye1 5 said she 7 2 man1 9 or 10 911 be 
combing ye ! 9 

4 Come on1 Queequeg19 said 101 9all right3 There's 
Mrs3 Hussey39 

And so 14 turned out 11 Mr3 Hosea Hussey being from 
home1 but leaving Mrs3 Hussey entirely competent 7 
attend 7 all 13 affairs3 Upon making known our de17 
sires for 6 supper 4 6 bed1 Mrs3 Hussey1 postponing 
further scolding for 2 present1 ushered us into 6 little 
room1 4 seating us at 6 table spread 18 2 relics 
5 6 recently concluded repast1 turned round 7 us 4 
said1 9 Clam or cod ? 9 

9 What 9s 12 about cods1 ma'am ? 9 said 101 18 much

4 clammy reception 8 2 winter time1 ain't 141 Mrs3 
Hussey ? 9 

But being 8 6 great hurry 7 resume scolding 2 
man 8 2 purple shirt1 who 15 waiting for 14 8 
2 entry1 4 seeming 7 hear nothing but 2 word 
9 clam1 5 Mrs3 Hussey hurried toward an open door 
leading 7 2 kitchen1 4 bawling out 9 clam for two1 9 
disappeared3 

9 Queequeg19 said 101 9 do you think 12 we can make out 
6 supper for us both on one clam ? 9 

However1 6 warm savoury steam from 2 kitchen 
served 7 belie 2 apparently cheerless prospect before 
us3 But when 12 smoking chowder came 81 2 
mystery 15 delightfully explained3 Oh1 sweet friends ! 
hearken 7 me3 It 15 made 5 small juicy clams1 
scarcely bigger than hazel nuts1 mixed 18 pounded ship17 
biscuit1 4 salted pork cut up into little flakes 11 2 
whole enriched 18 butter1 4 plentifully seasoned 18 
pepper 4 salt3 Our appetites being sharpened by 2 
frosty voyage1 4 8 particular1 Queequeg seeing 13 
favourite fishing food before him1 4 2 chowder being 
surpassingly excellent1 we dispatched 14 18 great 
expedition : when leaning back 6 moment 4 bethink17 
ing me 5 Mrs3 Hussey's clam 4 cod announcement1 
10 thought 10 would try 6 little experiment3 Stepping 
7 2 kitchen door1 10 uttered 2 word 9 cod 9 18 great 
emphasis1 4 resumed my seat3 In 6 few moments 2 
savoury steam came forth again1 but 18 6 different 
flavour1 4 8 good time 6 fine cod-chowder 15 placed 
before us3 

We resumed business 11 4 while plying our spoons 
8 2 bowl1 thinks 10 7 myself1 10 wonder now if this here 
has any effect on 2 head ? What 9s 12 stultifying 
saying about chowder-headed people ? 9 But look1 



CHOWDER 83 

Queequeg1 ain't 12 6 live eel 8 your bowl ? Where 9s 
your harpoon ? 9 

Fishiest 5 all fishy places 15 2 Try Pots11 which well 
deserved its name 11 for 2 pots there were always boiling 
chowders3 Chowder for breakfast1 4 chowder for 
dinner1 4 chowder for supper1 till you began 7 look for 
fish-bones coming through your clothes3 The area before 
2 house 15 paved 18 clam-shells3 Mrs3 Hussey wore 
6 polished necklace 5 codfish vertebra 11 4 Hosea 
Hussey had 13 account-books bound 8 superior old 
shark-skin3 There 15 6 fishy flavour 7 2 milk1 too1 
which 10 could not at all account for1 till one morning 
happening 7 take 6 stroll along 2 beach among some 
fishermen's boats1 10 saw Hosea 9s brindled cow feeding 
on fish remnants1 4 marching along 2 sand 18 each 
foot 8 6 cod's decapitated head1 looking very slipshod1 
10 assure ye3 

Supper concluded1 we received 6 lamp1 4 directions 
from Mrs3 Hussey concerning 2 nearest way 7 bed 11 
but1 20 Queequeg 15 about 7 precede me up 2 stairs1 
2 lady reached forth her arm1 4 demanded 13 har17 
poon 11 she allowed no harpoon 8 her chambers3 9 Why 
not ? J said 10 11 9 every true whaleman sleeps 18 13

CHAPTER XVI 

THE SHIP 

IN bed we concocted our plans for 2 morrow3 But 7 
my surprise 4 no small concern1 Queequeg now gave 
me 7 understand1 12 16 had been diligently consulting 
Yojo 2 name 5 13 black little god 4 Yojo had 
told him two or three times over1 4 strongly insisted 
upon 14 everyway1 12 instead 5 our going together 
among 2 whaling-fleet 8 harbour1 4 8 concert 
selecting our craft 11 instead 5 this1 10 say1 Yojo earnestly 
enjoined 12 2 selection 5 2 ship should rest wholly 
18 me1 inasmuch 20 Yojo purposed befriending us 11 41 
8 order 7 do so1 had already pitched upon 6 vessel1 which1 
if left 7 myself1 101 Ishmael1 should infallibly light upon1 
for all 2 world 20 though 14 had turned out by chance 11 
4 8 12 vessel 10 must immediately ship myself1 for 
2 present irrespective 5 Queequeg3 

10 have forgotten 7 mention 121 8 many things1 
Queequeg placed great confidence 8 2 excellence 5 
Yojo's judgment 4 surprising forecast 5 things 11 4 
cherished Yojo 18 considerable esteem1 20 6 rather 
good sort 5 god1 who perhaps meant well enough upon 
2 whole1 but 8 all cases did not succeed 8 13 benevolent 
designs3 

Now1 this plan 5 Queequeg's1 or rather Yojo's1 touch17 
ing 2 selection 5 our craft 11 10 did not like 12 plan at 
all3 10 had not 6 little relied upon Queequeg's sagacity

duced no effect upon Queequeg1 10 15 obliged 7 acquiesce11 
4 accordingly prepared 7 set about this business 18 
6 determined rushing sort 5 energy 4 vigour1 12 
should quickly settle 12 trifling little affair3 Next 
morning early1 leaving Queequeg shut up 18 Yojo 8 
our little bedroom for 14 seemed 12 14 15 some sort 
5 Lent or Ramadan1 or day 5 fasting1 humiliation1 4 
prayer 18 Queequeg 4 Yojo 12 day 11 how 14 15 
10 never could find out1 for1 though 10 applied myself 7 
14 several times1 10 never could master 13 liturgies 4 
XXXIX Articles leaving Queequeg1 then1 fasting on 
13 tomahawk-pipe1 4 Yojo warming himself at 13 
sacrificial fire 5 shavings1 10 sallied out among 2 shipping3 
After much prolonged sauntering 4 many random 
inquiries1 10 learnt 12 there were three ships up for 
three-years9 voyages 2 Devil-Dam1 2 Tit-bit1 4 
2 Pequod3 Devil-Dam1 10 do not know 2 origin 5 11 
Tit-bit 19 obvious 11 Pequod1 you will no doubt remember1 
15 2 name 5 6 celebrated tribe 5 Massachusetts 
Indians1 now extinct 20 2 ancient Medes3 10 peered 4 
pryed about 2 Devil-Dam 11 from her1 hopped over 7 
2 Tit-bit 11 41 finally1 going on board 2 Pequod1 
looked around her for 6 moment1 4 then decided 12 
this 15 2 very ship for us3 

You may have seen many 6 quaint craft 8 your day1 
for aught 10 know 11 square-toed luggers 11 mountainous 
Japanese junks 11 butter-box galliots1 4 what not 11 but 
take my word for 141 you never saw such 6 rare old craft 
20 this same rare old Pequod3 She 15 6 ship 5 2 old 
school1 rather small if anything 11 18 an old-fashioned 
claw-footed look about her3 Long seasoned 4 weather17 
stained 8 2 typhoons 4 calms 5 all four oceans1 her 
old hull's complexion 15 darkened like 6 French grena17 
dier's1 who has alike fought 8 Egypt 4 Siberia3 Her 
venerable bows looked bearded3 Her masts cut some17

where on 2 coast 5 Japan1 where her original ones were 
lost overboard 8 6 gale her masts stood stiffly up like 
2 spines 5 2 three old kings 5 Cologne3 Her ancient 
decks were worn 4 wrinkled1 like 2 pilgrim-worshipped 
flag-stone 8 Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled3 
But 7 all these her old antiquities were added new 4 
marvellous features1 pertaining 7 2 wild business 12 
for more than half 6 century she had followed3 Old 
Captain Peleg1 many years her chief mate1 before 16 com17 
manded another vessel 5 13 own1 4 now 6 retired 
seaman1 4 one 5 2 principal owners 5 2 Pequod1 
this old Peleg1 during 2 term 5 13 chief mateship1 had 
built upon her original grotesqueness1 4 inlaid 141 all 
over1 18 6 quaintness both 5 material 4 device1 un17 
matched by anything except 14 be Thorkill-Hake's carved 
buckler or bedstead3 She 15 apparelled like any bar17 
baric Ethiopian emperor1 13 neck heavy 18 pendants 
5 polished ivory3 She 15 6 thing 5 trophies3 A canni17 
bal 5 6 craft1 tricking herself forth 8 2 chased bones 
5 her enemies3 All round1 her unpanelled1 open bul17 
warks were garnished like one continuous jaw1 18 2 
long sharp teeth 5 2 sperm whale1 inserted there for 
pins1 7 fasten her old hempen thews 4 tendons 73 
Those thews ran not through base blocks 5 land-wood1 
but deftly travelled over sheaves 5 sea 17ivory3 Scorning 
6 turnstile wheel at her reverend helm1 she sported there 
6 tiller 11 4 12 tiller 15 8 one mass1 curiously carved 
from 2 long narrow lower jaw 5 her hereditary foe3 
The helmsman who steered by 12 tiller 8 6 tempest1 
felt like 2 Tartar1 when 16 holds back 13 fiery steed 
by clutching its jaw3 A noble craft1 but somehow 6 most 
melancholy ! All noble things are touched 18 123 

Now when 10 looked about 2 quarter-deck1 for some 
one having authority1 8 order 7 propose myself 20 6 
candidate for 2 voyage1 at first 10 saw nobody 11 but 10 



THE SHIP 87 

could not well overlook 6 strange sort 5 tent1 or rather 
wigwam1 pitched 6 little behind 2 mainmast3 It 
seemed only 6 temporary erection used 8 port3 It 15 
5 6 conical shape1 some ten feet high 11 consisting 5 2 
long1 huge slabs 5 limber black bone taken from 2 
middle 4 highest part 5 2 jaws 5 2 right whale3 
Planted 18 their broad ends on 2 deck1 6 circle 5 these 
slabs laced together1 mutually sloped toward each other1 
4 at 2 apex united 8 6 tufted point1 where 2 loose 
hairy fibres waved 7 4 fro like 2 top-knot on some 
old Pottowottamie sachem's head3 A triangular opening 
faced toward 2 bows 5 2 ship1 so 12 2 insider 
commanded 6 complete view forward3 

And half concealed 8 this queer tenement1 10 at length 
found one who by 13 aspect seemed 7 have authority 11 
4 who1 14 being noon1 4 2 ship's work suspended1 
15 now enjoying respite from 2 burden 5 command3 
He 15 seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair1 wriggling 
all over 18 curious carving 11 4 2 bottom 5 which 
15 formed 5 6 stout interlacing 5 2 same elastic stuff 
5 which 2 wigwam 15 constructed3 

There 15 nothing so very particular1 perhaps1 about 
2 appearance 5 2 elderly man 10 saw 11 16 15 brown 
4 brawny1 like most old seamen1 4 heavily rolled up 
8 blue pilot-cloth1 cut 8 2 Quaker style 11 only there 
15 6 fine 4 almost microscopic network 5 2 minutest 
wrinkles interlacing round 13 eyes1 which must have 
arisen from 13 continual sailings 8 many hard gales1 4 
always looking 7 windward 11 for this causes 2 muscles 
about 2 eyes 7 become pursed together3 Such eye17 
wrinkles are very effectual 8 6 scowl3 

9 Is this 2 captain 5 2 Pequod ? 9 said 101 advancing 
7 2 door 5 2 tent3 

9 Supposing 14 be 2 captain 5 2 Pequod1 what 
dost thou want 5 him ? 9 16 demanded3

me again3 Marchant service indeed ! 10 suppose now 
ye feel considerable proud 5 having served 8 those 
marchant ships3 But flukes ! man1 what makes thee 
want 7 go a-whaling1 eh ? 14 looks 6 little suspicious1 
don't 141 eh ? Hast not been 6 pirate1 hast thou ? 
Didst not rob thy last captain1 didst thou ? Dost not 
think 5 murdering 2 officers when thou gettest 7 sea ? 9 

10 protested my innocence 5 these things3 10 saw 12 
under 2 mask 5 these half-humorous innuendoes1 this 
old seaman1 20 an insulated Quakerish Nantucketer1 15 
full 5 13 insular prejudices1 4 rather distrustful 5 all

4 then back 7 me 4 tell me what ye see there39 

For 6 moment 10 stood 6 little puzzled by this curious 
request1 not knowing exactly how 7 take 141 whether 
humorously or 8 earnest3 But concentrating all 13 
crow's feet into one scowl1 Captain Peleg started me on 
2 errand3 

Going forward 4 glancing over 2 weather 17bow1 10 
perceived 12 2 ship1 swinging 7 her anchor 18 2 
flood-tide1 15 now obliquely pointing toward 2 open 
ocean3 The prospect 15 unlimited1 but exceedingly 
monotonous 4 forbidding 11 not 2 slightest variety 
12 10 could see3 

9 Well1 what 9s 2 report ? 9 said Peleg when 10 came 
back 11 9 what did ye see ? 9 

1 Not much19 10 replied 9nothing but water 11 considerable 
horizon though1 4 there 9s 6 squall coming up1 10 think39 

9 Well1 what dost thou think then 5 seeing 2 world ? 
Do ye wish 7 go round Cape Horn 7 see any more 5 141 
10 eh ? Can't ye see 2 world where you stand ? 9 

10 15 6 little staggered1 but go a-whaling 10 must1 4 
10 would 11 4 2 Pequod 15 20 good 6 ship 20 any 10 

(thought 2 best 4 all this 10 now repeated 7 Peleg3 
Seeing me so determined1 16 expressed 13 willingness 7 
ship me3 

9 And thou mayest 20 well sign 2 papers right off1 9 16 
added 9 come along 18 ye39 And so saying1 16 led 
2 way below deck into 2 cabin3 



THE SHIP 91 

Seated on 2 transom 15 what seemed 7 me 6 most 
uncommon 4 surprising figure3 It turned out 7 be 
Captain Bildad1 who along 18 Captain Peleg 15 one 
5 2 largest owners 5 2 vessel 11 2 other shares1 20 
19 sometimes 2 case 8 these ports1 being held by 6 
crowd 5 old annuitants 11 widows1 fatherless children1 
4 chancery wards 11 each owning about 2 value 5 6 
timber head1 or 6 foot 5 plank1 or 6 nail or two 8 2 ship3 
People 8 Nantucket invest their money 8 whaling17 
vessels1 2 same way 12 you do yours 8 approved 
state stocks bringing 8 good interest3 

Now Bildad1 like Peleg1 4 indeed many other Nan17 
tucketers1 15 6 Quaker1 2 island having been originally 
settled by 12 sect 11 4 7 this day its inhabitants 8 
general retain 8 an uncommon measure 2 peculiarities 
5 2 Quaker1 only variously 4 anomalously modified 
by things altogether alien 4 heterogeneous3 For some 
5 these same Quakers are 2 most sanguinary 5 all 
sailors 4 whale 17hunters3 They are fighting Quakers 11 
they are Quakers 18 6 vengeance3 

So 12 there are instances among them 5 men1 who1 
named 18 Scripture names 6 singularly common 
fashion on 2 island 4 8 childhood naturally imbib17 
ing 2 stately dramatic thee 4 thou 5 2 Quaker 
idiom 11 still1 from 2 audacious1 daring1 4 boundless 
adventure 5 their subsequent lives1 strangely blend 18 
these unoutgrown peculiarities 6 thousand bold dashes 
5 character1 not unworthy 6 Scandinavian sea-king1 or 6 
poetical pagan Roman3 And when these things unite 
8 6 man 5 greatly superior natural force1 18 6 globular 
brain 4 6 ponderous heart 11 who has also by 2 still17 
ness 4 seclusion 5 many long night-watches 8 2

impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary 4 
confiding breast1 4 thereby chiefly1 but 18 some help 
from accidental advantages1 7 learn 6 bold 4 nervous 
lofty language 12 man makes one 8 6 whole nation's 
census 6 mighty pageant creature1 formed for noble 
tragedies3 Nor will 14 at all detract from him1 dramatic17 
ally regarded1 if either by birth or other circumstances1 16 
have what seems 6 half17 wilful over-ruling morbidness at 
2 bottom 5 13 nature3 For all men tragically great 
are made so through 6 certain morbidness3 Be sure 5 
this1 young ambition1 all mortal greatness 19 but disease3 
But1 20 yet we have not 7 do 18 such an one1 but 18 
quite another 11 4 still 6 man1 who1 if indeed peculiar1 
14 only results again from another phase 5 2 Quaker1 
modified by individual circumstances3 

Like Captain Peleg1 Captain Bildad 15 6 well-to-do1 
retired whaleman3 But unlike Captain Peleg who 
cared not 6 rush for what are called serious things1 4 
indeed deemed those self-same serious things 2 veriest 
5 all trifles Captain Bildad had not only been originally 
educated according 7 2 strictest sect 5 Nantucket 
Quakerism1 but all 13 subsequent ocean life 11 4 2 sight 
5 many unclad1 lovely island creatures1 round 2 Horn 
all 12 had not moved this native-born Quaker one 
single jot1 had not so much 20 altered one angle 5 13 vest3 
Still1 for all this immutableness1 15 there some lack 5 
common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad3 
Though refusing1 from conscientious scruples1 7 bear 
arms against land invaders1 yet himself had illimitably 
invaded 2 Atlantic 4 Pacific 11 4 though 6 sworn 
foe 7 human bloodshed1 yet had 16 8 13 straight 17bodied 
coat1 spilled tuns upon tuns 5 leviathan gore3 How 
now 8 2 contemplative evening 5 13 days1 2 pious 
Bildad reconciled these things 8 2 reminiscence1 10 do 
not know 11 but 14 did not seem 7 concern him much1

4 very probably 16 had long since come 7 2 sage 4 
sensible conclusion 12 6 Oman's religion 19 one thing1 
4 this practical world quite another3 This world pays 
dividends3 Rising from 6 little cabin-boy 8 short clothes 
5 2 drabbest drab1 7 6 harpooneer 8 6 broad shad17 
bellied waistcoat 11 from 12 becoming boat-header1 
chief mate1 4 captain1 4 finally 6 shipowner 11 Bildad1 
20 10 hinted before1 had concluded 13 adventurous career 
by wholly retiring from active life at 2 goodly age 5 
sixty1 4 dedicating 13 remaining days 7 2 quiet 
receiving 5 13 well-earned income3 

Now Bildad1 10 am sorry 7 say1 had 2 reputation 5 
being an incorrigible old hunks1 4 8 13 sea 17going days1 
6 bitter1 hard taskmaster3 They told me 8 Nantucket1 
though 14 certainly seems 6 curious story1 12 when 16 
sailed 2 old Categut whaleman1 13 crew1 upon arriving 
home1 were mostly all carried ashore 7 2 hospital1 
sore exhausted 4 worn out3 For 6 pious man1 especi17 v 
ally for 6 Quaker1 16 15 certainly rather hard-hearted1 7 \ 
say 2 least3 He never used 7 swear1 though1 at 13 
men1 they said 11 but somehow 16 got an inordinate 
quantity 5 cruel1 unmitigated hard work out 5 them3 
When Bildad 15 6 chief mate1 7 have 13 drab-coloured 
eye intently looking at you1 made you feel completely 
nervous1 till you could clutch something 6 hammer or 6 
marling-spike 4 go 7 work like mad1 at something or 
other1 never mind what3 Indolence 4 idleness perished 
from before him3 His own person 15 2 exact embodi17

body 16 carried no spare flesh1 no superfluous beard1 
13 chin having 6 soft1 economical nap 7 141 like 2 worn 
nap 5 13 broad-brimmed hat3 

Such1 then1 15 2 person 12 10 saw seated on 2 
transom when 10 followed Captain Peleg down into 2 
cabin3 The space between 2 decks 15 small 11 4

there1 bolt-upright1 sat old Bildad1 who always sat so1 
4 never leaned1 4 this 7 save 13 coat-tails3 His 
broad-brim 15 placed beside him 11 13 legs were stiffly 
crossed 11 13 drab vesture 15 buttoned up 7 13 chin 11 
4 spectacles on nose1 16 seemed absorbed 8 reading
